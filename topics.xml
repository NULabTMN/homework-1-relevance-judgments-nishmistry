        <text>WHITE STAR LINE TO BUILD
BIGGEST SHIPS YET PROJECTED
By Associated Press.
LIVERPOOL. April Two new
White Star liners which will be the
largest vessels yet projected will be
laid down at Belfast next June. The
exact measurements of the steamers
have not been given out/but they will
be over 840 feet In length, 78 feet in
breadth and with a gross tonnage of
45,000, or 50,000.
The ships are to be fitted with com
bination turbines and reciprocating
engines guaranteed to maintain a
speed of twenty-one knots. The names

        <text>A MIGHTY CRADLE FOR GIGANTIC TWINS.
This aantry cost $\COO,COO. It was erected fop the express purooie of corstructinn the two new
White Star steamships, Olympic and Titanic.

ONE MILLION FOR A STARTER
After an expenditure of J1.C00.000 the great stee!
j double gantry which will bo the cradle of th» larg
! est two steamship In the world ha« been finished
I at the shipyards of Harland  "WoifT. at Belfast.
Ireland. The steamers whose keel blocks haT»
I been laid side by side in this the biggest gantry
j In the world are the Titanic and th« Olympic, of
| the White Star Line, and within a year or two
I these leviathans will b« running between New Tori*
! and Southampton.
Soon after the two fast Cunarders. too Lusl-
I taria and the Mauretania, had demonstrated that
I one could travel in luxury and at a very high
i speed through tha agency of turbine engines. th«
White Star X-in» announced that it would build
two steamers to beat the Oinarders la length and
breadth, and perhaps In other ways also. It was
reported at the tim» that th« new Whlta Star
■ liners would be a thousand feet in length, but sub
sequently it was officially announced that they
i would bo 900 feet lons, with a beam of ninety feet.
j When It was decided to build them it was found
' that there was no gantry In thm world big enough
! to accommodate such monsters, and It was then
. that Hrland  Wolff began to rip up three of Its
', largest gantries and build the hug* steel and con
' crete cradle that Is now ready to bold th* Olympic
• and the Titanic.
Before th* steel structure which supports th*
i powerful electric travailing cranes was erected a
' big concrete base, twenty fret thick, was built upon
sp!le3 driven fifty fe«t into tha ground. The con
crete foundation, in addition to being more firm
than the regular earthen base, has the advantage
of cleanliness, an 1 tools and materials which mar
fall from the cranes la the course of construction
may be found more readily. Parts of deck fittings
end tools have fallen into the ground la gantries
with earth bases and have not been recovered
' until the vessel has gilded from Its cradle into the
: water.
The construction of the Olympic has been started.
' The keel of the Titanic will be laid soon, and
' visitors to the shipyards at Belfast will have an
opportunity of seeing the simultaneous csnstrcs
. tion. side by side, of the largest two steamers tn
; the world. The gantries are so built that any
piece of material, however heavy or awkward, may
[ be placed and held In whatever position the con
atructora desire. The gantries themselves are more
than a thousand feet in length. 3C3 feet high and
something more than two hundred feet</text>

The Titanic and the Olympic W3l
lie Largest Steamships in World.
Although what will be the largest two steamships
In the world, the Titanic and the Olympic, of the
White Star Line, are mere skeletons just now in
their Lie million-dollar double gantry at Belfast,
Ireland the marine architects know exactly bow
they are going to look when they start on their
maiden passage to this port. From the plans and
specifications the designers have made a wush
drawing showing bow 'he monsters will look when
In the water and ready to sail. Although at nrst
glance the illustration suggests the Isauretania and
Lusitania. with their four gigantic funnels, there
Is something in the appearance of the new levia
thans that Is typical of a White Star steamship.
The great height of the new liners and the broad
sweep of the bridge elves some idea of their 80.J80
tons displacement. The builders have almost elimi
nated the old cusr im of carying masts, «nd In this
respect the targesi ships in the world resemble the
Old Dominion steamers, tha smallest passenger
carrying vessels in the American coastwise service.
All the old Dominior Mners have only one mast.

Thrse tw vessels are being built simultaneously

year before the keels were laid, and which cost
over a million dollars. The new liners will each

beam la equivalent to the length of some of the

vessels will have A displacement or
GOOOO tons They are to bo about
910 feet long with 0 beam or 90
feet and tho boat deck will bo mora
than 60 feet above the water
Neither the Olympic nor the Titanic
will bo highpower boats nor are their
lines designed for great speed 21 knots
being the average almod at as
against the 25 of the Cunnrdors All
immense amount of space which III
fast boats IG devoted to machinery
will thus be saved for cabin accomm

Each steamship will carry under nor

sons all told
The crow will bo the largest ever
employed on one merchant ship
more than GOO In all The monster
now liner will have nine steel decks
The steamers arc not only designed
to eclipse everything else as yet
achIeved In passenger shipbuilding nq
regards the size but In their novelty
of equipment as well There will be a
large entrance hall a spacious din

rooms elaborately furnished to the

homo
The Olympic and Titanic will ho the

cafe to another enjoYing practically
as much variety ns he might ashore
A veranda cafe will bo built on one
of the upper decks far astern looking
out over the sea and about fifty feat
above the water The decorations and
general management will carr out the
Idea of the openail cafes ot Southern
Eurore The cafe will be erected with
exposed rafters entwined with vines
and the sides will be latticed effects
to make the illusion of a cafe at the
seaside as complete as possible
Another novelty will be n Jrlll room
The cabin will suggest an old English
chop house with hlghbacled stalls of
ancient oak and broad low tables It
will be possible nt any hour of the day
or night for a passenger to use the
grill room The palm garden will be
still another refuge for those who
weary of the confines of the ship dur
ing the lall5age
A garden will be located on the sun
deck and 111 the winter months will bo
protected by a glass roof Here will
bo found perhaps the most complete
illusion or the hotel ashore There will
be arbors artfully contrived to give the
effect of gardens covered with vines
and lowers The chlldlens room ot the
new liners wlll be the most sumptuous
apartment or Its kind ever attempted
The new liners will be as complete In
their safety devices as In their luxuri
ous equipment Each boat will be di
vided Into upward or 30 steel compart
ments separated by heavy bulkheads
An automatic device on the bridge will
control all these heavy steel door
making It possible for a single hand to
close them all In case ot danger Each
of these doors In turn will be electric
ally connected with a chart on the
bridge and wIn be represented by small
electric lights When one or these
doors closes the light will burn red The
officer on the bridge will thus be ahl
to see at a lance If all of the com
partments are closed Still another set
or safety devices will guard against
fire In every part of the ship
A combination of turbine and recIpro
cating engines will propel the vessels
It Is expected that a great economy
or coal will be effected by this ar
rangement The berths In Harland
Volfs yards at Belfast In which
those wonderful ships arc being built
are each 1000 feet long and capable of
bearing a dead weight of i5OOO tons

        <text>TITANTIC SAILS ON
HER FIRST VOYAGE
White Star Liner the Largest
Vessel that Ever Sailed
the Seas.
(National News Association)
LONDON, April 10. Carrying 1400
passengers the liner Titanic of the
White Star line, than which there is
no larger vessel afloat, sailed from
Southhampton today on her maiden
voyage bound for New York. The Tt
tanic which is of 45,000 tons displace
ment Is sister ship to the Olympic.
All the special suites of rooms in
stituted as an innovation in the Titan
ic were occupied when the passage be
gun. These suites consist of bed
rooms, sitting room, bath room, and
servant's room and have their own
private deck promenade isolated from
the rest of the ship and not overlooked
by any other passengers.
The Titanic also possesses another
new feature in its Louis XVI. restaur
ant. Her sister ship the Olympic, also
has this feature but on a smaller
scale. It proved so popular, however,,
that the White Star company decided
to have Jhe one on the Titanic greatly
enlarged. Adjacent to it is a special
reception room for the use of passen
gers taking meals in the restaurant.
The Titanic while its engineering
principal is the same as that of the
Olympic, is expected by experts on
navigation to make faster time than
the Olympic because of a slight dif
ference in the curvature of the propel
ler blades. .</text>

This is Vice President Frank-lin'-s

"About twenty minutes to two
Monday morning I was awakened
by a reporter on the telephone

the Titanic had sent out calls for
assistance. " ,
"The press association repeat
ed whqt the reporter told me. I
asked them if they couldn't hold
back the news until it was con
firmed. They told me it already
had gone out. .
"I sent a Macconigram to the
captain of the Olympic asking
him to get into communication
with the Titanic. I then told all
our people to report to -the of
fice. "I then received the report that
the Titanic had been struck- by an
iceberg and was sinking by the
head. It was a press dispatch.
"But we had no authentic in
formation. '
"At 3 a. m, we sent another
wireless to the Olympic, again
urging it to get into communica
tion with the Titanic.
"At 6 a. m. we sent another
message to the Olympic. At that
time we had. absolutely no mes
sage from the Titanic. mj j ,
"About 1 o'clock we 'got an
other message from Captain Had
dock that the Carpathia was in
attendance and had picked np
twenty of the Titanic's boats fill
ed with passengers.
"We told the public these were
mets rumors.
"About 3 p. m. Monday, we
sent a message to the Olympic
oraering it to reiay messages
from the Carpathia.
"About 6:27 p. m. we received
the following message:
" 'Carpathia reached Titanic's

He said that he knew, nothing
of the Iifesaving devices on -the
Titanic, except that they were up
to the standard for ocean liners.
When pressed for the reasons
for getting Titanic's officers and
crew out of the country, Franlclin
declared that it was because sail
ors were sq "difficult to control."
He did not say if this also was
the reason for the desire of Mr.
Ismay, managing director, to get '
out of the countrv.

The appalling magnitude of the wrecking of the liner Titanic is
little mitigated by the fragmentary information which filters in today.
The rescuing steamer Carpathia has 868 survivors on board, ac
cording to the latest news received at the White Star offices in New
York city. This increases the list of the saved by about 200 from the
number at first reported. But with the revised figures at hand, there
still remain 1,850 persons, composing passengers and crew of the Ti
tanic, who today are unaccounted for—apparently lost.
The hope that the steamers Virginian and Parisian of the Allen
line had picked up additional survivors was dispelled when the' wire
less station on Sable island gave cut the information that the Parisian
had picked up no survivors, and a wireless message from the captain
of the Virginian said: ‘“‘Arrived at scene of disaster too late to be of
service.”
The Carpathia is coming to New York slowly. She will be in wire
less communication with Sable Island tonight.
London, New York and Paris are grief stricken and overwhelmed
by the terrible disaster. Tearful crowds thronged the steamship offices
in all the cities, awaiting hour after hour for news.
Many prominent people of both continents are among the miss
ing. No word has been received of Colonel John Jacob Astor, although
his wife is known to have been saved. Alfred G. Vanderbilt was not
on the Titanic, as at first reported. Isador Straus, the New York mill
ionaire merchant and philanthropist, who was on board, is not reported
among the survivors,
Associated Press.
New York, Apr. 16.—Brief wireless dispatches show that the pas
sengers and crew passed through thrilling experiences from the mo
ment the monster Titanic crashed into an iceberg in the dead of night
until the steamer Carpathia, several hours later, reached the scene and
rescued the survivors from lifeboats floating in a sea of ice.
The collision occurred at a timc when the passengers had retired
or were about to go to bed for the night, and the tremendous shock
oi the collision caused many of the passengers to rush to the decks
only partly dressed.
At once the passengers were ordered to the lifeboats, and many
were only scantily clad as they took their places in the boats. This
would indicate that the condition of the Titanic was such that there
was no time to return to the state rooms for additional clothing. Dan
ger confronted even those who were fortunate enough to be put into
the lifeboats.
Huge quantities of field ice covered the ocean, and in the dark
ness the crews had to guide the boats with the greatest care in order
to avoid being jammed and overturned. The ice was so heavy that
the crews could not keep the boats together and they were widely
separated. The air was biting cold and the chill breezes from the ice
floes caused the passengers to huddle together to keep warm. Through
out the night the lifeboats bobbed helplessly among the cakes of ice.
Shortly after 2 o'clock the sinking Titanic made a great dive into
the sea, carrying hundreds of persons to their death.
Finally daylight came, and with it arrived the Cunard Line steam
er Carpathia, which found only a score of lifeboats, filled with shiver
ing people, driving helplessly aboutthe vicinity where the Titanic had
gone undex the waves.
Associated Press.
St. Johns, N. F., Apr. 16, 3:45 p.m—All hopes of saving any of
the passengers or crew of the Titanic, other than those who are now on
board the Carpathia, have been abandoned this afternoon. All of the
steamers which had been cruising near the scene of the disaster have
continned on their voyage.
Associated Press.
Paris, Apr. 16.—The White Star Line office is besieged by weep
ing women, several of whom have scns on board. Among these were
Miys. William Dulles, who collapsed from the strain.
It has been established that Lady Duff Gordon, well known in Par

Halifax, N. S, Apr. 16.—The Parisian steamed through much of

The Parisian reports that the weather is so cold that, even if any
persons were on the wreckage, they probably would have perished from
exposure before they could have bern picked up.

learned, his wife did not accompany him on the trip.

New York, Apr. 16.—1 n the long roll of marine tragedies, that
which overtook the Titanic is the first instance on record wherein a
conspicuous vessel has met disaster on her maiden voyage. The nearest

She went to the port of missing ships on her second voyage. Carrying
about 300 persons all told, she steemed out of this port on her return

steamboat inspection service.

New York, Apr. 16.—The off‘cial announcement that there are 868
survivors on board the Carpathia, and the fact that the names of only
315 of the saved have been sent in by wireless indicates that there
are 553 persons saved whose names were not included.

Washington, Apr. 16.—Presid-nt Taft has directed that two reve
nue cutters be sent to meet the Carpathia. The scout cruiser Salem
which has the strongest wireless equipment in the navy, will also meet
the Carpathia and gather the namcs of the survivors.
A complete list of the survivors, likewise of the dead, will not be
available for days.

New York, Apr. 16, 10:30 a.m.—Messages received here shortly
after 10 o'clock by Marconi wireless from Cape Race and Sable island
say that none of the Titanic's passengers are on board the Parisian or
the Virginian.
Associated Press.
London, Apr. 16.—The underwriters at Lloyd's are staggered by the
news: but it is declared that the insurance on the Titanic is so evenly
distributed that none of the underwriters are likely to be hard hit.
The reassuring cable dispatches of yesterday had sent the re-insur
ance rate down to 25 per cent, and the underwriters closed up at night
hopeful that all was well. Whed the offices re-opened this morning a
little business was done at 90 guineas, but the rate quickly raised to
95, which is known as the total-less rate.
It is estimated that, together with her cargo, the Titanic would
represent a loss of approximately 12,500,000 pounds. Of this 750.000
pounds is retained by the White Star Steamship Company at their own
risk and the balance is placed on the insurance market in London, Liv

This afternoon he made public the full text of the wireless mes

“was because it was so discouraging that I thought it would not be
right to alarm the public unnecessarily. Now that the worst is known,
I am willing to give it out. It is as follows:
** ‘Carpathia reached Titanic's position at daybreak. Found boats

Titanic Tragedy Presents Picture
Without Precedent of Bravery of
Impulse, Unstudied, Unassuming
and Instinctive, Alike in Steerage
Passenger, Stoker and Millionaire
—True Tales Neber Told.
New York, April 20. —Nearly a week
has passed since the Titanic, greatest
marine achievement in the history of
the world, sank in mid-ocean. Much
of her story still is untold, and many
a day will pass before the world will
fully comprehend the significance of
the disaster.
The number of dead probably will
never be exactly determined, inas
much as the complete passenger list
went down with the vessel. The num
ber of survivors is fixed at 705 by the
report of Captain Rostron of the Car
pathia. Tbe White Star line officials
believe the death list totaled approxi
mately 1,635.
Day of Sorrow Tomorrow.
The narratives, gathered piecemeal
from the liner’s survivors, pay a trib
ute without precedent to the bravery
of the men and women of these mod
ern days, a bravery of impulse, un
studied, unassuming and instinctive,
alike in steerage passenger, stoker
and millionaire. By common consent
the churches of the world will set
aside their pulpits tomorrow for a
reverent consideration of the disaster
and for mourning for the lost.
Provision for the Living.
As to the needs of the living, am
p’.e provision is rapidly being made.
The relief funds being gathered in
New York and London already total
well up in the hundreds of thousands.
Most of the steerage passengers who
reached New York distraught and
penniless have already come to realize
the generosity and hospitality of
America. Clad, fed and housed, they
will be given ample time to recover
from the shock of their experience and
will stajt their life in the new world
with ample funds and kindly advice
of excellent counsellors.
Story of Vessel's Fate.
The most complete story of the Ti
tanic’s fate yet obtained is being rap
idly gathered in New York by the
members of the Senate investigating
committee. The committee has al
ready listened to the testimony of J.
Bruce Ismay, managing director of
the White Star line; Captain Rostron
of the Carpathla, Charles W. Light
holder, second officer of the Titanic,
and others. The witnesses for today’s
session include H. J. Pittman, third
officer of the Titanic; J. G. Roxhol,
fourth officer; G. Lowe, also in an of
ficial position on the Titanic, and fif
teen of the crew.
The committee has the assistance
of George Uhler, chief of the United
States steamboat inspection service, (
and Truman H. Newberry, who was I
secretary of the navy under Theo-|
dore Roosevelt.
Thought Vessel Unsinkable.
The burden of testimony presented (
emphasizes the unquestioning faith of
the Titanic officers in her unsinkable
character, the recklessness of steam
ing full speed through a sea where
dangerous icebergs were known to
threaten and the remarkable calm- (
ness of passengers and crew. The Ti-|
tanic’s fa’e already has resulted ii
action by the trans-Atlantic lines to
insure liners taking a course far *.o i
the south, where the iceberg danger (
will no longer be present. The linos,
it is announced, have agreed on a new
“long” course, which dips far to the
south of the Titanic's course. There
is little disposition to criticise. Cap
tian Smith for following the ocean
lane in which he met disaster. He
showed caution, according to the na-1
val hydrographers, in steering a
course well to the south of the regular
southern lane.
The Northern Course.
The northern course, used by ves- 1
seis from July to January, crosses the
grand banks in latitude 45 north, four
degrees further north than the south
ern or “long course,” In which the
MEMBER OB THE: ASSOC IATED rr ESS
- Titanic met its fate. The Titanic was
sixty miles south of the regular south
ern course and was even in danger of
collision with east-bound steamers.
The new route eastbound provides
that steamships shall dip to latitude
» 38.20 on the first third of their course,
f making a total distance from New
York to Fastnet of 3,000 miles, where
J the distance now’ is reckoned at 2,858
5 1 miles. The loss of time on the new
s course will be about nine hours for a
24-knot boat. Boats of the Olympic
class may be eleven or fourteen hours
longer in crossing. They will gain,
• however, in having clear weather
t most of the time, avoiding delays from
f fog. There w r as some criticism among
i the ’survivors here of the Titanic
’ crew’s inability to handle the life
l boats.
No Boat Drills.
Albert Major, stewart on the Titan
l ic, admitted that there had been no
• boat drills and that the lifeboats
- were poorly handled.
“One thing comes to my mind above
! all else,” he said. 4, We of the crew
■ realized at the start of the trouble
1 that we were unorganized] and al
thought every man did his best, w’e
were hindered in getting the best re
sults because w’e could not pull to
-1 gether. There had not been a single
boat drill on the Titanic.”
Story By a Fireman.
One story, told by a fireman, runs.
“The engineers stayed by the pumps
and went down with the ship. The
firemen and stokers were sent on deck
five minutes before the Titanic sank,
when it was seen they would inevit
ably be lost if they stayed longer at
their work of trying to keep the fires
in the boilers and the pumps at work.
The lights burned to the last because
the dynamos were run by oil engines.”
With the sailing of a majority of
the Titanic’s crew on the Lapland
some sources of interesting informa
tion have been closed until the Red
Star liner reaches the other side.*
United States Senator Smith believes
certain members of the crew’ that he
held here for examination may reveal
just what happened to the Titanic be
low decks when she struck the berg.
Second Officer Lightholder says the
Titanic did not break in two, but
made her dive diagonally into the
sea, and that when half way under
there were two explosions, which he
believes were boilers.
Survivors Doing Nicely.
The survivors in the hospitals are
reported to be doing nicely. Contri
butions to the survivors’ relief fund
continue to pour in. and more than fif
ty thousand dollars has been rai/ed.
Happy were the members of the
Titanic’s surviving crew as they pre
pared to depart on the Lapland. Gen
erous merchants and others had fitted
them out with clothing, hats, brushes,
razors and other things, together with
money for their immediate needs. Oth
er money will be sent later by the
relief committees.
Ismay Is Angry.
J. Bruce Ismay discussed with in
t terviewers the work of the Senate
• investigating committee, which he
I characterizes as “brutally unfair.” He
J said: “I cannot understand this sen-
I atorial inquiry. They are going at it
( in a manner that seems unjust, and
the injustice lies heaviest upon me.
Why, I cannot even protect myself by
’ having my counsel ask questions.
Don’t misunderstand me by thinking
1 mean questions calculated to twist
.witnesses up; on the contrary, ques
tions tending to simplify involved
meanings.”
Has Clear Conscience.
Discussing his departure from the
Titanic, Mr. Ismay said:' “1 have
searched my mind with deepest care.
I have thought, long over each single j
incident that I could recal). I am •
sure that 1 did nothing that I should
not have done. My conscience is clear, |
and I have not been a lenient judge
of my acts.
Chance Came to Him.
“I tell you that if I thought that in
the slightest way I had done any
j wrong I would never have another
; happy moment. I took the chance of <
1 escaping when it came to me—l did [
not seek it. Every woman and child
had been cared for before I left the
boat. 1

had been taken care of before I took
my turn. And why shouldn’t I take
my turn? There are only two classes
on ship—the crew and the passengers.
I was a passenger.
“It is true 1 am president of the
company, but I didn’t consider myself
any different from the rest of the pas
sengers, 1 took no other man’s place.”
J. Bruce Ismay and other officials
of the White Star line were sub
poenaed today by the Senate investi
gating committee to appear before it
in Washington Monday. The investi
gation in New York will be concluded
today.
LITTLE GIRL DIES.
Stood With Captain on Bridge When
the Titanic Went Down.
New York, April 20.—Taking refuge
on the bridge of the ill-fated Titanic,
two little children remained by the
side of Captain Smith until that por
tion of the big ship had been swept
under w’ater. Survivors of the crew
who went down with the Titanic but
were saved by clinging to an overturn
ed lifeboat today told of their gallant
commander’s effort to save the life of
one of the children. He died a sail
or’s death and the little girl who had
entrusted her life to his care died
with him.

ISMAY HEARD.
Officers of White Star Line Clear Up
Several Points.
New York, April 20— J. Bruce Is
may, managing director of the White
Star line, is to be recalled before the
Senate investigating committee now
delving ifito J|ie facts surrounding the
wreck of the Titanic. He probably
will be summoned io testify in rebut
tal before the day’s testifying is over,
according to Senator Smith of Michi
gan, chairman of the committee, who
acknowledged this morning that it
was the intention of the committee
to have the White Star line’s chief
executive again before it for the pur
pose of clearing up several poin's that
now appear to be in dispute by wit
nesses.
Wanted to Be Excused.
Although Mr. Ismay urged the com
mittee to permit him to go for the
present, pleading that he was on the
verge of a nervous collapse by reason
of his experiences, his request was
I not granted. There will remain as
witnesses four officers and twelve
1 members of the crew and they will be
heard as quickly as possible. The in
dications are that the inquiry will not
be completed before the middle of
next week. Just before the Senate
committee investigating the Titanic
disaster me', an invalid chair was
wheeled into the committee room, tn
it was Harold Bride, the assistant
wireless- operator on the Titanic,
whose feet were wrenched and badly
injured when he was crushed in the
liferaft that picked him up. He was
sallow and hollow-cheeked and lay
propped up with pillows awaiting his
call to the witness chair.
Will Add Lifeboats.
Immediately behind Bride came J.
Bruce Ismay, president of the Inter
national Mercantile Marine, and P. A.
S. Franklin, vice president of Ihe or
ganization. Mr. Ismay announced be
fore the inquiry began that ho had
given instructions to all the lines of
the Interna'lonal Mercantile, Marine,
which Include the White Star, the
American Red Star, the Leland, the
Atlantic Transport and the Dominion
lines, to equip all steamers with suf
ficient lifeboats and raft boats f>r
every passenger and every man of
the crew, without regard to govern
ment regulations.
Operator on Stand.
The first witness was Thomas Cot
tam, the wireless operator on the Car
pat hia, who was recalled to the stand.
Senator Smith sought to clear up the
TEN PAGES
messages that had passed between
the Carpathla and the Titanic.
What was the last message sent
to the Titanic?" asked Senator Smith.
"We sent It word to have its life
boats ready," said the witness; "that
our lifeboats were ready and that we
were steaming to them as fast as we
could."
Keeping Back the News.
Senator Smith asked a question to
discover whether any official had
sought to keep back news of the dis
| aster.
"Did you send any message that all
the passengers had been saved or that
the Titanic was being towed to Hali
fax?"
"No, sir."
"Nor anything like it?”
“No, sir.”
"Did you know such reports were
being published, to the world?”
“No, sir."
"If the White Star line sent a mes
sage Monday reading: ‘Representa
tive J. H. Hughes, Huntington, W. Va.;
Titanic proceeding to Halifax; passen
gers probably will land there Wed
nesday; all safe,’ they did not obtain
the information on which that is bas
ed from you?"
“No."
“Nor do you know that it obtained
it from any other operator on the Car
pathia?"
“No.”
Senator Smith asked the witness if
he had received a message from the
time the Carpathla left the scene of
the disaster until it reached New
York.
“No, sir,” answered Cottam. "I re
ported the entire matter myself to the
steamship Baltic at 10:30 o’clock Mon
day morning. I told them we had
been to the wreck and had picked up
as many of the passengers as we
could.”
Much Sleep Lost.
Cottam repeated his testimony of
yesterday and said he had been with
out sleep throughout Sunday, Monday,
Tuesday and until late Wednesday aft
ernoon. Senator Smith sought to have
the witness designate the exact hour
when he was relieved by Operator
Bride, who had been taken aboard the
Carpathla from the Titanic.
“I don't know, sir,” said Cottam in
extenuation. "1 was up continuously
and I lost track of the hours and days.
I had from eight to ten hours sleep
from the time we left the wreck until
we arrived In New York.
“Did Bride do any sending in that
time?" Senator Smith asked.
"Yes sir. He sent the list of the
third-class passengers to the cruiser
Chester.”
"Any other message?"
“Several; I don’t remember what
they were. The records are on the
Carpathla."
"Did you or Bride send any message
declaring that the Titanic was being
towed into Halifax?"
“No, sir,” said the witness, with
emphasis.
Titanic Operator.
Senator Smith then called what he
evidently expected to be one of the
most important witnesses, Harold S.
Bride, the sole surviving wireless op
erator of the Titanic. Crippled as a
result of his experiences, he was
wheeled in an invalid’s chair to the
table where the committee sat.
“Contrary to the usual procedure,”
said Mr. Smith, “I must place you un
der oath.”
Bride remembered receiving and
sending messages regarding the speed
lof the Titanic on its trial tests. After
leaving Southampton on the Titanic’s
fatal trip, he could not remember re
ceiving or sending any messages for
Ismay.
| After testifying that he had made
no permanent record of the iceberg
warnings, Bride insisted he gave tin;
memorandum of the warning to the
officer on watch. The nam'e of the of
ficer he could not tell.
I "1 know the officers by sight but
not by name," he said. Ho did not in
. form Captain Smith. Bride said he
saw Phllllppß in the operating room.
Told of Injury to Boat.

        <text>A Graphic, Continuous Tale of the First
and Only Voyage of the Bi??est
Ship in the World That Ended
So Disastrously Off the Great Ji
Newfoundland Banks.
The Hymn That the Ship's Band
Played r % the Vessel Went Down.
The Captain and Officers of the Titanic.?From Left to Right, Dr. W. F.
N. O'Laughlin, H. T. Wilde, Chief Officer; Chief Engineer Fleming;
Purser McElray.?Seated, Capt. E.J. Smith.
Now that the first shock of the Ti
tanic disaster, with the succession of
wild rumors which it brought, has
given place to something like certain
knowledge of what occurred on the
terrible night that the giant liner
plunged to the bottom of the sea, the
following complete narrative of the
wreck, with the events that preceded
and followed It, is rendered most time
ly. With Its swift alternations of
scenes of horror and heroism, of grim
struggles for life and awful suffer
ings, It is probably the most dramatics
true story of the sea ever written.
It is printed at the request of many
readers.
THE giant Titanic of the White
Star Line, the biggest ship afloat
when she sailed from Southamp
ton, England, on April 10, on her
maiden voyage to the Port of New
York, lies to-day a broken wreck, 2,760
fathoms beneath the ocean's surface,
some 800 miles from shore off the
great Newfoundland Banks. The ship
that was unsinkable, In the minds of
her leakers and the men that ran her,
has been sunk. The Queen of the Seas
is less to-day than one of her lifeboats
which bobs up and down on the broken
surface of the Hudson River, safe be
tween the piers of the White Star Line.
And in her sinking the Titanic ex
acted greater toll than humanity ever
before had been made to pay for Its ef
forts to conquer the sea. Of the 2,340
persons composing passengers and crew
of the big liner, only T05 over reached
this port. More than two-thirds of
those who embarked on the Titanio for
her maiden Journey?1,635 persons ex
actly?went down with her when she
snubbed her nose beneath the waves,
hung, quivering an instant, half above
and half below the surfaco, and then
started her downward plunge to the
bottom, nearly two miles bolow.
Since then the cable ships Mackay
Bennett and Mlnla have been pt the
scene of the wreck searching for bldies.
Some have been identified by articles
In the clothing and are now on their
way to Halifax aboard the Mackay
Bennett. Altogether 205 liad been picked
up last Thursday, The steamship Is
due there this morning. Others were
recommitted to the sea after it had
been found that they were unrecogniza
ble. The Minia will remain at the
scene of the disaster for some days to
come, and it will not be until there Is
a fair certainty that everybody recov
erable has been found that the search
will be abandoned.
It was collision wltji an iceberg which
caused the destruction of the Titanic,
and thoee who would moralise over the
great ship's loss can see in such a meet
ing the hand of Fate, which required
the greatest example of man's handi
work afloat on the sea to point its
protest against his ambition. For It
seems certain that nothing less than an
Iceberg could have withstood collision
with the enormous Titanic. Than her
no ship which sails the seas 'riras better
prepared to meet unexpected encoun
ters with others. Even a war vessel,
the heaviest Dreadnought, probably
must have succumbed to the rushing
Impetus of the monster Titanic had
they Jostled each other In the narrow
lanes of the ocean.
It had to be something greater than
any ship afloat to sink the Titanic, and
that something was supplied In the
tremendous berg, eight-ninths of whose
bulk skulked beneath the waves while
it presented a paltry lump of Ice, some
120 feet in height to do combat with
the steamship.
It Is thirteen days since the Ti
tanic sank?fourteen since she plunged
into the berg. Through many of those
days her owners and those who waited
ashore for news of dear ones aboard
the big liner were forced to be con
tent with meagre wireless accounts
Of the accident. In the Titanic's
passenger list were such names as Col.
and Mrs. John Jacob Astor, Major
Archibald Butt, military aid to Presi
dent Taft; James Clinch Smith. Dr.
Washington Dodge, Assessor of Port,
San Francisco; Mrs. Dodge and child.
Sir Cosmo and Lady Duff-Gordon.
Charles M. Hays, President of the
Grand Trunk Pacific of Canada, his
wife and daughter; W. T. Stead. Ben
jamin Guggenheim, F. D. Millet, the
artist; G. D. Widener of Philadel
phia, Countess Rothes, Mr. and Mrs
Isidor Straus. J. B. Thayer, Vlce^l^resl
dent of the Pennsylvania Railroad, his
wife and son; T. D. M. Cardeza, Clar
ence Moore of Washington, Robert W.
Daniels of Philadelphia, J. Bruce
Ismay, President of the International
Mercantile Marine Company, owner of
the line; Henrv B. Harris, the theatrl- j
cal manager, and Mrs. Harris: Thomas
Andrews, designer, and Archie Frost,
Chief Engineer for Harland & Wolff
the Titanic's builders.
Many of these and of the others
aboard the Titanic had postponed or
advanced their dates of sailing from
Europe, In some instances paying large
bonuses, for the privilege of making
the Titanic's maiden voyage. For
many of these passengers there was in
terest felt ashore, and inquiries were
made not ohly by members of their
families and by friends, but by persons
connected with them in business or
whose fortunes would be Influenced by
their life or death.
For such anxious Inquirer*) there were
many hours of suspense before even a
partial and Inaccurate list of the sur
vivors was wirelessed ashore from the
Cunarder Carpathla which rescued all
of the Titanic's passengers who were
saved. From this, lists of those who
had gone down with the steamship were
devised, and later, when bodies were
found floating on the scene of the
wreck, lists of those who had been
identified were made.
Meantime t the Carpathla, most anx
iously awaited of all ships which were
nearing the Port of New York,
brought In her cargo of surviv
ors, and with them the first au
thentic story of the wreck, of how
the great ship had struck, of what oc
curred aboard her after her bottom
plates had been ripped off by contact
with the Iceberg and her fifteen water
tight compartments had begun to fill,
of how the order was given to take to
the boats and of how It was fulfilled,
of the conduct of officers and crew and
of passengers, especially that of those
whose names were famous throughout
the world; of how the lifeboats were
launched and of the long hours of wait
ing in these cockleshells while the Car
pathla was steaming at extraordinary
speed from many miles away. News of!
all this the Carpathla brought, but
mostly It was told by rescued passen
gers, still too excited to give more than i
impressionistic accounts of what had
befallen the giant ship and them.
The stories varied widely and in their
variances revealed how different may
be the impressions received in different
minds by the one occurrence. In the
main features the recollections of a
majority agreed. In detail they dif
fered, one from the other, as the imag
ination of one who recounted them dif
fered in quality from that of another.
It was not until the United States
Senate undertook an inquiry "into the
cause of the disaster that testimony
was obtained from which the actual
facts of the Titanic's sinking' could be
gathered. That inquiry is still under
way. As yet no blame has been fixed
for the worst marine catastrophe in re
corded history, but facts have been
brought out in the testimony of offi
cers of the ship, in the tales-of sur
vivors. and in the records of wireless
messages, sent and received, from
which an accurate account of the loss
of the Titanic, of the circumstances of
her encounter with the berg, of the ef
forts made to save the ship, and of the
death of the many and the savin* of a
few, can be constructed.

THE FATAL VOYAGE
Lasted Just Five Days and Ended
Two Miles Beneath Atlantic's 8urface
HE TITANIC sailed from South
I ampton, England, on Wednes
JL day, April 10. Scarcely "had she
drawn out of her berth when
she narrowly escaped collision with the
American liner New York, which was
yanked from her moorings, her haw
sers snapped, by the tremendous suc
tion exerted by the new steamship. The
great Titanic drew the New York to
ward her as an iron filing is drawn to
a magnet, and the smaller vessel float
ed, helplessly, stern first, down on the
giantess of the seas.
Her passengers lined her decks on the
side off which the New York lay,
laughing with pride that they were
aboard such a ship, when they learned
that it was the Titanic's suction which
had strained the New York from its
moorings. That the narrowly avoided
collision was prophetic of that other
collision in which the Titanic was to
play the part of the pigmy could not
have entered the mind of a single per
son aboard.
Then the big steamship gathered
headway again, moving slowly while
she was in range of other shipping,
that the occurrence of the New York
might not be repeated, but increasing
her speed as she left the shore behind
until finally she was racing through
ocean waves, cleaving to a line which
her navigators had lain down for her,
off at last on her maiden Journey with
New York as her goal.
" News of her starting was cabled to
that city and the departure from Eng
land of the greatest steamship in the
world was heralded far and wide. For
several days there could be no
news of her. She might speak other
ships, bound for foreign ports, or
ships headed as she was yet which
must bow to her superior speed and

follow her wake up New York Harbor,
but no word could come from them
sooner than from the Titanic herself.
New York settled down to await the
first report from the big ship, and it
came on Sunday, April '14, when, at
2:15 A. M., the Titanic was reported
1,284 miles east of Sandy Hook and
due in New York at 4 o'clock Tues
day afternoon.
The giant liner was no four-day boat.
In speed she could not compete with the
Lusitanla or ! Mauretania, though to
no others need she yield, but New York
was content to wait for the coming of
the greatest ship afloat.
The report from the Titanic would
come on Sunday in time for publication
in the newspapers of Monday morning,
and should show her 500 miles or more
nearer New York. That was the mes
sage which was awaited. Instead, late
on Sunday night, this is the message
which came:
CAPE RACE, Newfoundland, Sun
day night, April 14.?At 10:25 o'clock
to-night the White Star Line steam
ship Titanic called " C. Q. D." to the
Marconi wireless station here and re
ported having struck aa Iceberg. The
steamship said that immediate assist
ance was required.
Half an hour afterward another mes
sage came reporting that they were
sinking by the head and that women
were being put off in the lifeboats.
The weather was calm and clear, the
Tltanlc'8 wireless operator reported
and gave the position of the vessel as
41.46 north latitude and 50.14 west lon
gitude.
The Marconi station at Cape Race
notified the Allan liner Virginian, the
NfAW?v?0<M>,
Capt. A. H. Rostron, Commander of
the Carpathia, Which Rescued
the Survivors.
Captain of which immediately advised
that he was proceeding for the scene
of the disaster.
The Virginian at midnight was about
170 miles distant ffipm the Titanic and
expected to reach that vessel about 10
A. M. Monday.
2 A. M., Monday.?The Olympic at an
early hour this (Monday) morning was
in latitude 40.32 north and longitude
61.18 west. She was in direct communi
cation with the Titanic and is now
making all haste toward her.
The steamship Baltic also reported
herself as about 200 miles east of the
Titanic and was making all possible
speed toward her.
The last signals from the Titanic were
heard by the Virginian at 12:27 A. M.
"The wireless operator on the Virginian
says these signals were blurred and
ended abruptly.
This was the first word of the disas
ter received in, America. It was not
until many days later that authentic
news of the striking and sinking of the
Titanic was received, and it became
known how the accident had occurred.
Many of the facts were gathered
from the testimony of J. Bruce Ismay,
President of the International Mercan
tile Marine; Second Officer Charles
Herbert Lightoller of the Titanic, and
Harold Bride, the Marconi operator
aboard the Titanic, which was given
The Carpathia, Rescuer
before the Senate Investigating Com
mittee.
Their statements established the fact
that it was a clear, cold night when the
Titanic plunged into the iceberg. The
big vessel had been four days on her
way. Such passengers as had been un
acquainted when the steamship left
port, had established the cordial rela
tions which usually exist among fellow
passengers on an ocean voyage. Din
ner .was over and there were groups of
carefully gowned women and men in
evening clothes in the saloons. The
smoking rooms were filled. There were
games of bridge and other hazards at
cards in progress.
Outside the temperature had been
falling rapidly as the Titanic drew
nearer and nearer to the ice floes from
the midst of which rose the group of
icebergs on one of which the great ship
was to strike. Tests of the water had
been taken every two hours throughout
the day and evening, but these as yet
had failed to show a dangerous prox
imity to the ice field. The officers
were not alarmed, and in the mind of
no passenger, probably, was there a
thought of danger. The Titanic, they
believed, was unslnkable.
The big ship was plowing ahead at
good speed, and Second Officer Lightol
ler, who had taken the bridge at 6
o'clock, was still on duty. It was early
evening. In the crow's nest were Sea
men Flint and Leigh, keeping a sharp
watch ahead, for though the iceberg
fleet was not dreaded, it was known
to be near at hand. There were no
other lookouts except the men on the
bridge.
At 8:55 o'clock Capt. E. J. Smith j
mounted the bridge and consulted with
his second officer. The ship was mak
ing twenty-one or twenty-one and a
half knots. The weather was fine and
clear. A myriad stars dotted the heav
ens.
Capt. Smith spoke with Llghtoller of
the ice fields into which they were run
ning and* of the great Icebergs there.
Wireless warnings of the existence of
these fields and bergs and of their loca
tion had been received by the Titanic
from her sister liners, the Olympic and
Baltic, from the Hamburg-American
11
of the Survivors.
liner Amerika, and from other liners.
Capt. Smith was serious but not
alarmed. He had been amply warned,
and if other ships could have traversed
the field in safety, surely the giant Ti
tanic could make the passage.
He ordered Second Officer Llghtoller
to keep the Titanic on her course, but
to notify him if there arose the slight
est doubt as to conditions. Then he
left the bridge at 9:25 o'clock.
Thirty-five minutes later Chief Offi
cer Murdock relieved Lilghtoller on the
bridge. The weather held fine and
clear, though cold. The temperature
was 31 degrees, but was not considered
abnormal for the region in which the
Titanic was. The men discussed the
ice fields and bergs which the ship was
approaching, and decided that they
probably would encounter them in
about an hour. Their estimate was not
far wrong in view of the uncertainty
as to the exact location of the fields
which were constantly moving with the
currents, for it was at 11:30 that the
Titanic scraped over a submerged shelf
of the berg, tearing away the steel
plates of her bilge.
Two facts stand out prominently in
the sinking of the Titanic. One Is that
had the look-outs in the crow's nest
been equipped with binoculars the dis
aster might have been averted. The
iceberg which sent the great liner to
the bottom was sighted when there
was yet time to turn the steamship
sufficiently from her course so that
the impact of collision was felt by the
liner's starboard bow some twenty feet
from the stem. The warning given a
few seconds before probably would
have allowed time for the Tltanlo to
have been turned aside beyond the
range of the berg.
The other fact is that many persons,
most of them men. lost their lives need
lessly. Not one of the lifeboats which
pulled away from the sinking Tttanlo
apparently went with a full cargo.
Some of them carried less than half
the number which might have found
room in them. That this was so was
the result of the demre of most of the
men aboard to remain there till every
woman had been removed.</text>

        <text>Titanic Memorial to Be Unveiled in May]
%&&&
•——JHEMk^H
[ BY WILLIAM A. MILLEN.
_ -—EAR the City Mall in Belfast, Ireland,
. 7\ 7 stands an impressive monument
jj \/ commemorating the liner Titanic,
Y V built in that North Country capital,
*. and Washington will soon have as
Its latest memorial a monument that will con
jure up tragedy and peril and heroism on the
the high seas, the crunching of ice on steel,
•nd disaster nearly a score of years ago.
The Titanic Memorial is located at the foot
of New Hampshire avenue on the banks of the
Potomac River and has been in place for some
months. It will be unveiled in May as a lasting
reminder of that great maritime disaster. The
Belfast Memorial is hard by the River Lagan
and the famous cluster of shipyards, known as
“The Island,” from whose ways have slid down
▼easels to the four comers of the earth, among
them the Titanic.
Original plans for the unveiling in Washing
ton directed that it take place on the anniver
sary of the sinking of that ill-fated vessel,
majestic queen of the seas that went down in
a collision with one of the Ice King's minions
straying southward from the polar North. In
view of the unusual Weather conditions that
have prevailed for the past several months, the
sponsors of the unveiling have now decided
that the ceremony should be deferred until
May, when the weather is likely to be more
settled.
TJTGH hopes and despair; skill of craftsman
ship and maritime inefficiency; the latest
•f man's leviathans meeting disaster at the
hands of one of the world's oldest forces and
radio, playing a master part in the grim tragedy
that evoked primitive instincts of the fight for
life, are strangely mingled in this story that
will be perpetuated along the Rock Creek and
Potomac Parkway for the future generations of
Washingtonians.
There were sturdy men from the Counties
Antrim and Down, in Northern Ireland, in that
great giant of a ship, the Titanic, for had not
Belfast watched it grow with pride from just a
bit of a rib of steel to a magnificent hulk?
Belfast, more than any other city on the face
of the earth, stood aghast at the tragedy of
her sinking and felt more keenly her loss.
Belfast had fashioned this miracle of machinery,
had given of her best in her building, and then
ha/< sent her own as deckhand and fireman
over her gangplank, to sail away out of Belfast
Lough to Southampton on this Titanic, named
for the elder brother of Saturn, who made war
against him and was ultimately vanquished by
Jupiter.
The Titanic of the twentieth century met her
Jupiter as she was bound for New York some
where southeastward of Cape Race, Newfound
land, and some 1,600 miles from New York
City, in a colossal iceberg beneath the North
Atlantic stars. A compilation of figures made
soon after the tragedy says that the percentage
of women saved was 74, of children, 52, and
of men. 20. There were 817 passengers lost out
of 1,316. and 696 members of the crew went
down to a watery grave out of the total roster
of 908. Washington’s monument will do honor
to these brave men who stepped aside that
women and children might be saved.
Built at the famous shipyards of Harland &
Wolff for the White Star Line, the Titanic
steamed out of Belfast April 2 on her maiden
voyage. By April 10 she was out of South
ampton, England, and had made a call for

continental passengers at Cherbourg, on the
western coast of Prance, before heading toward
the setting sun. Queenstown, now known as
Cobh, in the south of Ireland, was her last port
of call, and she sailed blithely out into the
Atlantic breakers and on to disaster and the
fame that goes with great tragedy.
Capt. Smith, her skipper, was an officer of
some 40 years’ experience. On that happy day
in 1912, with the Pastnet and the hills of
Kerry drooping into the distance astern, as
lord of the Titanic he had achieved the zenith
of maritime ambition, for was not his craft the
mistress of the seas and Britain’s proudest
leviathan? Capt. Smith is said to have had but
one disaster in his long career on the waves
before the Titanic crashed.
RAILING supremely westward to the New
World, with glistening wood and steel, the
Titanic was a thing of beauty upon the sea.
Her passengers cavorted in the swimming tanks,
promenaded the decks, read In the spacious
lounges or listened to the latest music. Many
influential and powerful women and men in
the world of business, art, military and naval
circles and other lines of endeavor were aboard.
Out of the unseen came the first hint of grim
disaster, but little heed was paid. On the after
noon of April 14, 1912, the Titanic learned from
S. 8. America that that vessel had passed two
huge icebergs in latitude 41:27 north and
longitude 60:3 west. Similar warnings came
from the S. S. Baltic, on which Capt. Smith
had once served, and from the S. S. Californian,
but they were passed by.
That same evening the Titanic was steaming
westward at some 21 knots, with the weather
clear and bright starlight, when the lookout
shouted down to the bridge that there was ice
ahead. Contrary to popular belief, there was no
sudden lurch of the vessel as ice and steel met
in deadly collision, for authentic accounts of
the time say that many of the passengers and
crew did not know of the fatal impact.
As soon as the ice bank loomed up ahead in
the starlight night the engines were ordered
stopped and were then reversed, in an effort
to pull away from the wall of ice, and the
helmsman put her hard to starboard. Bulkhead
doors were closed from the bridge, according
to account, but all to no purpose, as the hidden
ice ledge had sheared eut part of the vessel’s
starboard side. The collision occurred about
11:40 pm. April 14 around latitude 41:46
north and longitude 50:14 west, just a com
paratively short distance from where icebergs
had been reported to her in the afternoon.
Boats were manned and lowered and cleared
from the vessel, but they were pitifully lacking
in equipment, and if the stories of the day
reflect the truth, there was an utter absence of
orderly safety measures, no general alarm and
insufficient lifeboats to care for all hands.
The vessel sank about 2:20 a.m. Monday,
April 15. 1912, and in that great tragedy the
history books have it that 1,517 lives were
lost. The horror of this major disaster oC
modern times swept the world, but the black
cloud of despair had its silver lining of stirring
heroism.
The Cunarder Carpathia. summoned by radio
by the disabled Titanic, added luster to the
name of Capt. Rostron, whose methodical com
mands for assisting in relief work are the
marvel of those that love efficiency in times
of peril.
“We are coming to your relief,” was the com
forting message that went out from the Car
pathian wireless shack into the night and
above the blue waves that carried the white
monsters of the deep—but it is doubtful if it
reached the wide audience it was intended for.
There were more than 2,000 persons aboard
the Titanic on the maiden voyage, and of that
number 1,517 perished. The tragedy would have
been even greater had it not been for the
efficacy of radio, which was to prove its mettle
for the first time in a major maritime disaster.
The Carpathia arrived about 8 am. and began
rescuing the occupants of the lifeboats.
QUT of that maelstrom of human misery have
come thrilling tales of heroism—Phillips
and Bride, the radio operators who refused to
leave their posts in the wireless “shack” of the
Titanic until almost the last minute, because
their skipper had not given the word to go,
even though the frigid waters were rising
momentarily. Phillips had time to give a cup
of water to a fainting woman in the hustle and
bustle of death. The musicians, too, played
their instruments and endeavored to instill
hope and courage into the hearts of the women
and children. Over the seas of memory eomes
the recollection of that hymn that was wafted
over the waters above the confusion and
tumult, “Nearer, My God, to Thee,” as the
Titanic was in her last throes.
Such as these will Washington’s monument
commemorate, though they sleep beneath the
waters of the North Atlantic. They will live
in the National Capital in a monument beside
a beautiful parkway on the banks of the
Potomac.
The magnitude of this tragedy at the front
door of the North American Continent had its
reverberations in the halls of Congress, which
inquired into the affair. Senator William
Alden Smith of Michigan made a speech on
May 28, 1912, and informed his colleagues of
the results of the investigation—a recounting
of inefficiency and culpability—of a lookout
that said he was without proper binoculars for
his work; of one of the icebergs, nearly 200
feet above the level of the sea, with seven
eighths of its bulk hidden beneath the waves;
of the sudden drop in temperature before the
Titanic struck; of the general air of indifference
on the part of the authorities aboard the
doomed craft, and of the lack of adequate
equipment to cope with such an emergency.
Maritime officials, after an examination of the
plans of the vessel, said that the double bottom
did not extend up the sides of the vessel in
order to assist in keeping her afloat after her
outer skin had been punctured and that her</text>

NEW YORK, N. V., June 15.— A fire
started in tue biggest of the Government
buildings at Ellis Island at 12:30 o'clock
this (Tuesday) morning, and, spreading
with frigbtinl rapidity, was at 1 o'clock
sweeping over the whole island, and it
seemed almost certain that every building
would be destroyed.
Telegraphic and telephonic communica
tion was cut off, but the tire had lit the
whole bay and every tug with fire ap
paratus on board started for the island.
By the time the police had started a great
crowd had gathered at Battery Park. The
flames were then shooting a Hundred tret
in the air, and by their light hundreds of
people could bo seen on the island rush
ing hither and thither.
There are usually more than 1000 per
sons, most of them emierants, who sleep
on the island. The customs officials
thought the number there when the
tire broke out less than 1000, most of
whom arr ved on three ships yesterday.
The officials thought tbe boats and men
Bent to the island were enough to handle
the immigrants who escaped from the
burning buildings, no matter how scared
they might be.
At 1:15 o'clock a great crash was beard,
and a moment later there was another
tremendous shower of sparks flying into
the air. When it had cleared a little it
was seen that two walls of the main
building had fallen in.
For two minutes after this crash the
crowds that had been seen on the island
rushing around were lost sight of, but
when the smoke cleared away it could be
teen that a hundred or more tugs had
reached the island and wore taking the
people aboard. At this time every build
ing and every shed seemed to be burning,
and there was absolutely no shelter for
the people anywhere. The beat was in
tense. The whole island is|ooly six acres
in area. The unfortunates were forced to
crouch, fur on the cater edge until the

At 1:30 o'clock thf ferry-boat John G.
Carlisle arrive 1 from the island with 200
emigrants and all the sick patients from

fought their way to the boat, the officer*

The crowd retreated pre.u>ita:ely. The

by Mrs. Wtiite, wife of the resident phy
sician. She said thnt when she boarded
the boat she had not heart of any one
being injured, and thought all the emi
grants got out of the buildings safely.
One of the oilu-ers of the boat said the
fire originated in one of the lowers of the
main building. At the time it started all
the emigrants were asleep. The watch
men sounded the alarms before they did

are connected by an elecric alarm, and
that ;ii qu.ckly as possitle he rushed to
the main ollice and rang the alarm in all
the rooms.
This alarm, he said, summoned the
eleven men and two women under him.
There were at the time 110 in
the main building. Cv the time these
people got out the whole building, from
tower to tower and side to side, was a
n.as.3 of swirling flame?, whi< h shot hun
dreds of feet in the a;r. Within a tew
minutes after the fire started the miserable
i water supply on the island was almost
completely cv: off|v bthe bursting ol pipes
which run along inside he main build
i ing, so that when the first detachment of
police arrived It was impossible to secure
a stream of water with enough force to
have any effeci.
Just directly north of the main build
ing stood the hospital in which were
lifty-seven patients. Ihe admirable dis
cipline of the nurses and medical staff
i shov.-ed itself and the fifty-seven patients
j were quickly wheeled or helped out of the
building. One woman who was nursing a
child suddenly lemembercd she had left
her baby behind. She beat the air with
her bauds and then tried to rush back
into the flames. She was held back by
tliree attendants. Presently the nurse
came around with the baby in her arms.
Every official a reporter saw on the
i island said positively that no lives had
i been lost. Ail the emigants were brought
to the barge office lor tne night. Com
missioner Seuner said he would person
ally furnish a place for all sick emigrants,
and the city hospitals would not be asked
to take ttiem.
Dr. Senner says the building* burned
cost the Government $780,000. He does
not know what accommodations can be
arranged for the receiving of emigrants
until they are rebuilt.</text>

No list of newspaper curiosities would be com

it has IM-t'ii published continuously for over a
thousand years. It began as a monthly, became
a weekly in 1361, and since the beginning ol
the century has been a daily. It is now quite
mi to date publishing three editions a day, and,
to safeguard the purchaser from wiles that are
not altogether unknown to the newsboys of

tlslom are similar. As In the first building, the
examination* are conducted on the second floor and
the baggage Is handled on the first floor. The big
examination room Is two rtorles high. It Is the
largect room in the building. On a level with the
third floor a railed visitors' gallery runs around It.
It Is fringed with the offices of the Immigration
o9dala, rooms for the meetings of the Hoard of
Special Inquiry, for records, for the Contract
Labor Bureau and for more minute medical and
contact labor examinations. The chief rooms on
The tMrfl floor are dormitories for detained Immi
grants.
GOOD 6ANTTARY CONDITIONS.
.Extrezas rare has been taken to have th* sanitary
condiUcr.s as close to perfection as possible. The
floors are of asphalt, with raised edges around the
walls, so that they can be thoroughly cleansed with
water. The walla for seven feet above the floors
are of X£eene cement. Above this they are of
white, hard surfaced plaster. There are no cor
ners where a hose may not be turned. The white
walls and the dark green trimmings are refreshing
to their suggestions or cleanliness.
Everything has been so arranged that the Im
migrant passes through the station very much
after the faanlon of a roll of paper through a web
press. Upon landing at the pier he enters a pas
sage which leads to the entrance of the examina
tion building. Once Inside, the passage leads up a
flight of broad stairs, which turn before reaching
the second floor, and discharges Its contents onto
the broad, open floor of the great vaulted examina
tion room. Here the preliminary medical Inspec
tion Is made. Th* immigrants Into whose physical
condition there should be further examination are
here weeded out and turned Into a room near by.
The others go forward through numerous narrow
aisles. These are the parting of the ways. As the
Immigrants leave them they a;e separated accord
tag to their destinations.
THREE PASSAGES FOB EXIT.
A stairway opens before the Immigrants as they
leave the aisles. It Is divided into three passages
by wire screens. Those for New-York now have
free access to the covered passage to the New-
York fern* Flip. Those who are to go away by rail
are taken bark through the building past the ticket
oSees and the big tt&ggaga room on the ground
floor, where the, baggage has been assorted Into
two divisions, that destined for New- York in one,
ar.a that going out on the railroads in the other.
The baggage for the railroads is properly checked,
and the immigrants are then taken to a steam
boat landing adjoining the one where they landed
*n? «-re transported to the railroad stations.
Those who are detained are ushered into a large
room to remain until further disposition Is made
""them Rccord:rif, to the merits of their cases.

        <text>TVsihiaston. Dec. Immigration to America,
dnris? the year ended .Tune SO. 1907. was vastly
cri*tcr than in any previous year of the history
or the United States. This fact; with all its in
t! resting and important details, is placed in strong
li-ht in the annual report of Frank P. Sargent,
t'oaimissloiier General cf Immigration, which was
made public to-day. Of this great flood of Immi
grants, Commissioner Sargent says:
4u arrr.y of 1,285,349 souls, they have come,
.drawn hither by the free Institutions and the mar
-•Jlotis prosperity of our country chance here
afforded every honest toiler to gain a. livelihood by
v,*. sweat of his brow or the exercise of his lntelli
ppnee surpassing in numbers the record of all pre-
ceding ears.
The report contains in tabulated form many
j.haFes of information bearing: on the question of
Immigration, and In submitting- this carefully com
piled data, Mr. Sargent says:
The immigration for the year 1907 exceeded that
♦or 2?C6 by 1£4.614 and that for the year 1905 by
rSF,SSO. or an increase over the year 1906 of
■more than 17 per cent, and over the year 1905 of
i^ore tlian 25 per cent. During the fiscal year 190f»
ir.432 aliens were rejected at our ports; during the
last year 13.064, an increase of 632 hence the total
r.nmbrr of those who have sought admission in JSO7.
viz_ 1.295.413. exceeds the number who applied in
I*o6. viz.. 1.113,167. by 185,246.
Commissioner Sargent says it is of particular
f ijniScance that many immigrants landed at ports
in the South during the last year, and he refers
rspecially to a party of 473 Belgians— excellent
types of immigrants— received at Charleston, S. C,
having been induced to go there by the state
authorities. The Increase of Immigration to the
South, the commissioner says, "is directly con
nected with the growing desire of the Southern
nates to draw within th«ir boundaries a number
cf the better cl££s of immigrants, it being consid
ered by practically all of the leading men of that
fecti that the future development and welfare of
the South depend on its ability to receive and
absorb a reliable laboring and farming element.
Striking increases are also shown at New Orleane,
ualveston sue Honolulu."
Of peculiar significance is the table which hows
the cumber ol immigrants from each foreign coun
try, together with the increases or decreases as
compared with the previous year. Twenty-seven
countries showed increases and eleven decreases.
The tide, of immigration from some of the countries
it, indicated by the following figures: Austria-
Hungary, 355.452: increase, 73.314; Bulgaria. Scrvla
and Montenegro. 11.253; increase, 6,693; France.
7.-! l: increase. 345; German Empire, 57.!>07; increase.
Greece, 36,590; Increase, 17.091; Italy, including-
Ficily and Sardinia. 253.751: Increase, 12.O1; Russian
Enpire and Finland. 1.".-.Hi:: increase, 43.C75; Tur
key. 13,767; Increase. 11.257; England, 56.637; increase.
7.14€; Ireland. 54,i30, decrease, 455; Scotland, 19.740;
increase. 5.574; China, 961; decrease. 653; Japan,
30.2K; increase, 16431: British North America, 19.916;
increase, 14,5i5; West Indies, 15.659; increase, 3.033.
Interest naturally attaches to th© proportlon
■Xfty large, immigration from Japan. While the
«ii l—ln 1 1 laws have rendered practically ml the
•immigration from China, the immigration from
Japan, although relatively riot great, has trebled
In the last year. This Increase is significant, too.
because it comes in the face of regulations adopt
d by the American government, -with the assent of.
Japan, •which, it was supposed, would curtail the
immigration of. Japanese to this country very ma
terially.
Commissioner Sargent presents excerpts from
official reports made to his bureau by inspectors
«-ent to Mexico and Canada to study the. situation
with special reference to the coming of Japanese
to America, through those countries. The reports
that thousands of Japanese landed in Mexico
curing the last year and ultimately gained admis
sion surreptitiously into this country. Once in the
United States, it "was impossible to find them, ex
cept in the rarest instances.- While the regula
i ions concerning Japanese immigration have tend
ed to reduce the number of regularly admitted cm
migrants, hundreds if not thousands of Japanese
ttill are coining into the country by stealth.
Referring to the immigration figures from the
various countries. Commissioner Sargent says the
"furnishes a striking illustration of the fact
S hat the time has arrived when if people are dls
catiafied with existing political, economic and social
conditions en one country, they will find the means
by which to desert their former homes and settle
•where a fairdiance is afforded them. Its chief
interest to the people of the United States con
sists in the question that must arise in the mind
of eny person examining the nsTires as to whether
not our ability as a race to absorb foreign ele
ments is not on the verge, at leapt, of being over
taxed."
The financial condition of admitted aliens ia al
»-aye an interesting subject. Of those admitted
573.523 had less than *50 each in their possession,
•anile lOT.X'C were able to show amounts in excess
of that sum. The total amount of money brought
into the country by arriving aliens was SZJ&.V&.
or an average of almost a person.
Of the 13,064 aliens who were turned back dur
ing the year 1,434 were contract laborers, but the
cumber of contract laborers deported during the
last year was 36 per cent less than in the precsd
iE=: year.
A table showing th* outward passenger move
ment during the last year develops the fact that
that movement was greater than in any preceding
year for which statistics are available. The total
Turober of cabin pess*'ngers was 224, and other
than cabin 344.™*. The aggregate number of out

i nat marine hospital surgeons be stationed at the
principal ports of embarkation abroad to examine
aliens before th v start for America.
i n surgeons and inspectors, male ani female, be
placed on vessels of the principal steamship lines
to examine incoming aliens.
That arrangements be perfected for the detection
or members of tho criminal classes who seek to
come, to the United States.
That a treaty be negotiated with Mexico respect
ing immigration through that country: or. if that
cannot hi- done, that the Mexican border be close.!
to all except American citizens and bona fide resi
dents of Mexico.
That a harmonious arrangement be made with th«
Canadian government respecting the enforcement of
the immigration laws of that country and the United
States.
That immigration stations be erected at Boston,
Philadelphia and Baltimore.
That appropriations be made for improvements

Ends Operations
NEW YORK, l^i—Ellis Island is
closed after serving as the gate
way to America for millions of im
migrants during the past 62 years.
The tiny island in New York har
bor in recent years served chiefly
as a place to keep deportees. Im
migrant clearance abroad reduced
the number detained on the island j
to almost nothing.
Last Friday the last of 50 persons
still detained on the island were
moved to the mainland and Ed
ward J. Shaughnessy, district im
migration director, said: "Business
is closed.”
The immigration service will
keep a skeleton crew on Ellis. If
New York City or some federal
agency does not take over within
a year, the island will revert to
the government’s General Services
Administration.

Am Montag letzter Woche fand vor
dem Regeln-Eoniite des Repräsentan
ten bemies ein Verhör bezüglich der
Zustände auf Ellis Island statt, deren
genaue Untersuchung von der Resolu
tion des Mongreßinaitnes Sulzer an
gestrebt wird. Zuerst hatte»! die Geg
11er der Resolution ihr „Inning".
No. 1, der Zar von Ellis Island,
Moinmtffär Williams, der eine vier
Viinbige Rede hielt und mit einer gan
zen Wagenladung von ofsizielleil Do
kumenten bewaffnet war. Der Mom*
miftär beklagte sich zunächst, daß Nie
mand e i i Beschwerde über bru
tale Behandlung von Einwanderern
geführt habe, und verwies dann auf
feinen bekannten Erlaß dann gab er
ein Bild von Ellis Island und seiner
Administration. Früher Hätten die
Einwanderer schlechtes Essen bekom
inen, jetzt würden sie ausgezeichnet
verpflegt. Ungeziefer gebe eS auf El
lis Island nicht Höchstens daß gele
gentlich Einwanderer solches mitbrach
teil, das dann sofort deportirt würde*
ob mit oder ohne die Einwanderer,
verschwieg Herr Williams. Dann
zeigte er dem Eomitc Photographien
der Schlafräume und DetentionSräu
me, auf denen wirklich nichts von Un
geziefer zu entdecken war.
Der nächste Punkt war eine Vertei
digung gegen den Vorwurf, daß häu
fig Einwanderer deportirt würden,
trotzdem ihre Verwandten für sie die
zur Zulassung nötigen Geldmittel auf
Ellis Island de^onirteii. Der Moni
miffär erklärte, an den Mnssendkpor
tationrn sei er nicht schuld, sondern
lediglich die Dampfer-Geieflicharten,
die beständig unerwünschte Elemente
herüberbrächten.
Die Danlpser-Gesellschaften bräch
ten nändig Leute, die kurzsichtig wä
ren, Bronchitis. Brüche. Plattfüße
oder Mrampfabem hätten, oder nicht
einmal normales Gewicht aufzuweisen
hätten, nach hier, und solche Leute solle
er zulmfeu. Er könne bis tier nur,
wenn ein Einwanderer eilte ansteckende
I
Krankheit habe, eine Geldstrafe von
$100 über die betreffende Dampfer
Gesellschaft verhängen, er befürworte
aber, daß er gesetzlich ermächtigt wer
de, eine Strafe von 50 oder minde
stens 25 Dollars für Fälle wie die
oben geschilderten zu verhängen.
Daun zitirte der Kommissar eine
Uiimenge von Fällen, in denen Depot*,

griff die bekannte Entscheidung von

Als einer der Hauptredner zu Gun

Herr Theo. Sutro. der Präsident der
Ver. Deutschen Gesellschaften von New

rik. Natioualverbandes, eine gehar
nischte Rede, in der er 11. A. folgende
Erklärungen abgab: Wir sind eine
patriotische Vereinigung, der es nur
darum zu tun ist, die Wohlfahrt un
seres Landes, der Vereinigten Staa

die Willkürherrfchaft auf Ellis Island
die Zustimmung und Untersiiitzung
der gesammten deutschen Presse des

durch das. was ich sagen werde, auch
einem Protest von dieser Seite Aus

fast alle anderen in nicht englischer

„Iii Bezug auf die Sache selbst

Argumente widerlegt.
Herr Sutro nahm sodann in einer
einsinndigen Rede Pnnkt für Punkt
die von den Rednern der Opposition
gemachten Einwendungen auf und wi
derlegte sie in überzeugender Weise.
Er betonte speziell, daß Mommissär
Williams hier einige Dutzend Fälle
sich ausgesucht hätte, in denen die Te
portatioiu zweifellos gerechtfertigt
war er hätte diese Zahl zweifellos
verzehnfachen und verhundertfachen
können, ohne damit zn beweifen, daß
nicht dennoch Tausende ungerechter*

schloß bann wie folgt:
„Der Ztueii der Untersuchung ist
doch haupttsächlich, daß das Gesetz

sondern daß speziell dieses Beamten

        <text>Lights of New You'k
by L. L. STEVENSON
Byron H. Uh], alert and erect
district director of the immigration
and naturalization service, probably
has come into close contact with
more immigrants than any other
man in the world. Recently he
celebrated the completion of 50
years on Ellis island, the great gate
way to the United States. True,
Ellis island is not a gateway now
because the‘war has stopped immi
gration. At present. Ellis island is
merely a place of detention for
enemy aliens just as it was in the
First World war. - Nevertheless, in
the half century Mr. Uhl has been
stationed at Ellis island. a mighty
ﬂood of newcomers to this land has
passed before his eyes.
Those great "immigration races"
of the early twenties are well re
membered by Mr. Uhl. They should
be, because there were many times
when the lights of Ellis island burned
all night that the great human tide
might be diSposed of as soon as pos
sible. The law which took effect in
1921 was the cause. Under the pro
visions of that act, not more than
20 per cent of the quota of any one
nation could be admitted in a
month. 59 ships would anchor in
Gravesend bay the iast day of the
month and at the stroke of midnight,
would dash for quarantine, frequent
ly in such numbers that the Narrows
were all but clogged. The eagerness
of skippers to be ﬁrst in line was
easily explained. If their passen
gers were not admitted they had
to be returned to their native lands
at the steamship company’s ex
pense. . In 1924, 'the law was so
amended that no visas were issued
abroad without a quota number-
Mr. Uhl, when a lad of 18. came
to Ellis island in 1892 as a stenogra
pher. That was soon after Ellis is
land succeeded Castle Garden as an
immigration station. Castle Garden
later became the well - known
Aquarium. Ellis island then con
sisted of only 3% acres with one big
wooden building which burned in
1897. Now the island is 27% acres
in extent and there are 37 red brick
and limestone buildings. In 1903.
Mr. Uhl was promoted to inspector.
He went down to quarantine in cut
ters only three months. however. be
cause then he was promoted to chief
clerk. In 1909, he became assistant
commissioner and in 1933, was
named director which made him
second in rank to the commissioner.
The ofﬁce of commissioner was abol
ished in 1940,and Mr. Uh] then be
came the immigration head of the
countty’s largest and most impor
tant port. - . '-
or.
Thirty-ﬁve years ago Mr. Uh]
established a home in Rutherford.
N. J. To reach Manhattan, he trav
els under the river in the Hudson
tubes. Then, down at the Battery,
he takes a dingy government ferry
to reach Ellis island. His day’s work
over, he reverses the journey. So
taking it all in all, water ﬁgures no
little in his life. Now at the age of
68, after half a century on an island,
he is looking forward to a little home
in the country. But that won’t come
until he retires. ' -
Speaking of Ellis island, here is
something that can be told now. In
the rush days, Ellis island was much
in the news. There were also maga
zine and other articles concerning
conditions there due to overcrowd
ing and the manner in which new
comers to these shores were hano
dled by island ofﬁcials and guards.
Many of the articles were unfavor
able and naturally the immigration
department was not pleased. Hence,
reporters who came to the island to
get a story, instead of being permit
ted to prowl around, were routed to
Mr. Uhl's ofﬁce, with guards seeing
that they traveled in a direct line.
Mr. Uhl was always courteous and
as helpful as possible. But being a
government ofﬁcial, he was ruled by
Washington orders.
One day a newspaper man, in
search of ﬁrst-hand information.

thing for a reporter) and having ex

guardian of the ferry portalsr trav
eled to Ellis island with a ﬂock of
relatives of immigrants. He started
for Mr. Uhl’s ofﬁce all right, but at
the opportune time. ducked into a
corridor. He hadn’t gone far before
he encountered a guard. But by
pretending not to understand Eng
lish, he was shooed right to a place
he wanted to see. By keeping that
up and always looking extremely
dumb, he eventually learned all he
wished to know. The result was a
page article that brought a lot of
compliments from a Sunday editor
and others. While digging up facts
about Mr. Uhl for this column I
happened to ﬁnd that page. hence

Bnuona Tor Believing that the Planet is
Inhabited.
The conditions which favor the blief
in the existence of life in the planet
Mars present the clearest possible evi
dence ot being one in origin and structure
with our own earth. We cannot tell
wnat the nature of the soil of Mars may
be, but its generally ruddy tince so
well marked that, though the telescope
shows an almost equal part of the surface
to be greenish in hue, the red prevails,
giving to the planet, as seen by the naked
eye, its obvious red color eee'ms to show
that it resembles the red sandstone of
our own earth. This, we know, is one of
tne oiaer geological tormations, and if we
could safely compare terrestrial with
Martian geology, or, let us say, geology
with aerology, we might almost be
tempted to find in the present prevalence
of a tint belonging to one of the earlier
of our terrestrial formation an argument
in favor of the theory that Mars passed
through fewer stages of development
during its life bearing condition than
on r earth, and that thus the later forma
tions of our earth's surface are wanting
in the surface of Mars. This reasoning
would not be very safe, however, it im
plies a resemblance in details which is
not likely, the observed rule of nature
seeming so far as we can judge, to be
similarity in generals, variety in details.
We may well believe that the ruddiness
of the soil of Mars is due to the same
general cause as the ruddiness of our
red sandstone the general prevalence of
certain organisms but neither the actual
character of this particular formation,
nor its position in the territorial series of
strata can be safely predicted of the
ruddy formation constituting the chief
part of the visible land surface of Mars.
Few will now suppose with a French
writer that the ruddiness of Mars is due
to the color of the vegetation there. A
certain support is given to the idea by.
the circumstance that the degree ot rud
diness is variable, and is somewhat
greater during the Martain summer than
in spring and autumn. In this sense we
may say of the summer of Mars with the
poet Wendell Holmes :
The snows that glittered on the disc of Mars
Have melted, and the planet's fiery ob
Bolls in the crimson summer of its year.
But the ruddiness of the planet's sum
mer which will be well marked this
year, for on September 18, only eleven
days after its time of nearest approach
and greatest splendor, it will be mid
summer's day lor the southern half of
Mara can be otherwise and better ex
plained than by supposing that the
Martian forests glow with fiery foliage
during the summer days. We can see,
as the summer proceeds, the white mists
which had hidden the planet's lands and
seas breaking up, and the features of the
surface being gradually revealed with
more and more distinctness. It is to the
disappearance of these mists and clouds,
not to the red leaves of Martian trees,
that the change in the plant's color must
most probably be referred. We have less
reason for doubt as to the nature of the
greenish markings. The spectroscope, as
we have already explained in "Life in
Mars," shows that the air of Mars is at
times laden heavily with the vapor of
water. We can no longer, therefore,
follow Wbewell in doubting the real na
ture of the green parts of the planet, or
refuse with him to accept explanation of
the white polar marking long since ad
vanced by Sir W. Herschel. Undoubt
edly wide seas and oceans, with many
straits and bays and inland seas, exist on
Mars. Snow and ice gather in the win
ter time about his polar regions, dimin
ishing gradually in extent as summer
proceeds, but never entirely disappearing.
Thus we are not left doubtful as to the
general resemblance of Mars, so tar as the
structure of his surface is concerned, to
the earth on which we live. He has a
surface of earth, probably in large part
formed by deposition at the bottom of
former seas and subsequently raised
above the sea level by subterranean forces,
or rather caused to appear above the
surface by the effects of the gradual
shrinkage of the planet's crust. Cornhill

        <text>How Life in Mars Goes On.
In the case of the planet liars, and in
the case of the planet Mars -alone, oar
astronomers have really established the
existence of a similarity of physical con
dition, which gives us the strongest posi
tive grounds for inferring that even such
creatures as we now are could somehow
make shift to live there, though, of course,
not without a certain amount of preli
minary discomfort while we were trying to
acclimatize ourselves. Mr. Proctor's
graphic account f these similarities, and
his delightful chart of the planet's conti
nents and waters, suggests to ub to discuss
one or two of the known differences of
condition, in their relation to the probable
results upon the history and civilization of
the Martialists.
First, let us briefly say that the Mar
tialista have a world less in area than one
of our hemispheres to explore ; that, in
spite of this, it has not much less land than
the earth, a much less proportion of its
surface being occupied with water than of
our globe ; its seas are of the general type
of tne Baltic and Mediterranean, for the
most part narrow, straggling, inland seas ;
jthe greatest seas are in the neighborhood
of the cold south pole of Mars, which has
a climate far severer than the north pole ;
there is a world of perpetual snow at tach
Martial pole, which can be seen to diminish
as the summer returns to each hemisphere,
and to increase again as winter comes
back; and, in spite of the prepon
derance of land, a vast deal of rain falls on
Mars, especially in winter, clouds often
hiding the configuration of the continents
from our astronomers, and the suddenly
dispersing, and leaving the continents clear
again a clearing up which usually happens
about the hour of noon-in Mars, just as
our weather so often changes as the sun
passes the meridian ; that the length of the
Martial year is nearly twice as long as
ours; and that the force of gravity on
Mars is much less than half what it is with
us, so that, as Mr. Proctor expresses it, fa
Daniel Lambert on Mars would be able to
leap easily to a height of five or six feet,
and he could run faster than the best of
our terrestrial athletes."
The general result, then, of the tele
scopical observations on Mars, and the de
duced calculations, may be said to be :
(1.) With certainty, that the' weight of
objects of the same mass in Mars is much
less than half what it is here, and that
consequently there would be a far greater
range of activity for creatures of the same
size, that falls would be less dangerous,
that the strain on walls or columns, or any
other supports, would be much less ; and
that, therefore, roofs, arches and struc
tures of that kind might be easily set up
on a much larger scale by creatures of
equal skill with ourselves; but, on the
other hand, that friction, which is more or
less proportional to - pressure, and,
fore, in the case of piles of
stones, etc, to weight, would be far less
than on the surface of the earth, so that
any violent lateral disturbances, such as
hurricanes, would exert a still greater ef
fect than on our earth in destroying such
structures, since there would be less solid
ity and, therefore, less fractional resistance
to overcome in overturning them. Again,
the vastly diminished weight of given
masses would give a very great advantage
to all kinds of engines of draught Car
riages, carts and railways would attain a
vastly greater speed than on our earth, and
the sledging on the snow-fields of Mars
might be as swift as the wind. All these
inferences are matters of certainty, so far
as they go.
But (2) there seems a very great proba
bility that the atmosphere of Mars is re
latively considerable denser than ours,
since at a distance from the sun so much
greater that the planet probably receives,
directly, less than half the light and heat
we receive. There seems no sign of any
arctic severity, and clear evidence that the
atmosphere holds vast quantises of watery
vapr, even in winter, which points to a
temperature much higher than our world
would have if removed to the same dis
tance from the sun, especially when one
considers how much less water to supply
vapor, and how much greater a propor
tion ot iana man tne earth Mars contains.
Again, the rapidity with which storms
clear off from a big continent, and leave
the outlines clearly marked after being all
enveloped in mist before, seems to show
the existence of very rapid currents of air;
and this no doubt the greater inclination
of the axis of Mars, giving a greater range
to the northward and southward journeys
of the sun, would promote. Putting these
facts together, then, we 6hould infer that
tne atmosphere of Mars is, in proportion,
heavier than that cf the earth, and there
fore a wanner envelope for the planet ;
that its winds are more violent, and that
the great difficulty of the architects of the
planet is more likely to be the strengthen
ing of their structures against lateral forces
hurricanes, for instance than against
me buiuu 01 gravity. ineir outer walls
would hav,e to be comparatively much
more solid ; their difficulty in rising broad
arches and spacious roofs would be much
less; and locomotion on Mars must be
more easy and speedy, eeterit paribus, than
wcumouou on eann.
If this be so, we may see a fitness in the
much larger proportion of land in the
planet, and the comparative narrowness
ana smauness ot the s as. Probably life
in Mars is faster than it is here. It is very
improbable that the civilization of the dif
ferent continents there, is divided by peri
ods extending over two thousand years.
There is probably no one of the great con
tinental tracts 01 aiars Known there as
" the New World." If great migrations
of conquering races have taken place on
Mars, as on the earth, they have probably
uruHi eacn otner iaster, Having a less
surface to move over, less obstacles, per
haps, in the way, and greater advantages
in locomotion. We should not be sur
prised, too, if the Martialists had got
greatly ahead of us in resDect of n a vi rat
ing the air. We know that the density of
Ilia 1 1 J . . . . J
puwcb, as wuuie, lit jess man inree
fourths of tnat of our earth; so that it
seems uaeiy inai me tissues of the body
of a Martialist, which must be fed from
the substance of the planet, are. on the
whole, intrinsically lighter than those of
man s ooay. But, u the Martialists' bodies
are intrinsically lighter, and their atmos
phere a good deal heavier than ours, aerial
transit may be a very easy matter to them,
and it is quite conceivable that their
normal mode of locomotion may be through
the air.
Again, if we are right in supposing the
currents of air in Mars to be of more than
usual violence, while the solidifying force
of friction which resists them is much
smaller than here, it may be a reasonable
inference that " natural selection" has al
ready weeded out the loftier growing trees,
which would stand less chance in encount
ers with hurricanes than our own ; and it
is not improbable that the tendency of the
greater facilities for motion, and the great
er velocity of life in Mars altogether,
would be that all its animal inhabitants
range wider for their food, and obtain less
on a given area than on our earth.
We should be disposed to conjecture
that it is a world in which speed is greater
and of more importance than even on the
earth ; and, if so, it seems likely enough
that the difficulty we have supposed as to
the solidity of walls exposed to the atmos
pheric currents of Mars is got over as the
difficulty of building durable structures is
generally got over in our own tropics,
where earthquakes are so common by not
building durable structures at all, but only
very light and fragile ones a process
which would, of course, be much easier
where all the materials were lighter and
all motion swifter than with us. In a
word, it seems likely that the distinctive
feature of life on Mars is velocity; that
the creatures there live faster, move often
er, undergo more change just as the
planet itself passes through a far vaster
orbit (though its orbital velocity is not
quite so great as ours) in one of the
Martial years. But that such a character
istic would tend to quicken the progress
of the mind and of discovery is doubtfuL
With us civilization has never advanced
rapidly till it had become tame and, so to
say, plodding, and the excitements of local
change, at least, had become few. But
the great seasonal changes of Mars es
pecially in the southern hemisphere, where
the winter and summer are aggravated by
the enormously increased distance of the
sun at that period when his rays are least
direct, and his nearness at that period

jocb Discussion as to tbe Lights and
Marks on the Planet.
^semblances Between Mars and Earth
_We Cannot Tell Tet About the
Men Theré.
Are the people on the planet
Mars trying to signal the earth?
That is the question which the
work of the great Lick telescope
during the past few days has
aroused, as Mars has approached
nearer and nearer to the big Cali
fornia instrument, wTiich will soon
have opportunities for observation
sueh as were never known before
in the history of astronomy.
This may be the explanation of
the Btrange phenomena observed
this week at the Lick observatory.
The results thus far obtained have
already been so extraordinary as
to have made profound impression
upon the practical minds of the
astronomers there assembled.
Three great lights, forming a tri
angle, have been seen in the south
western limb of the planet. They
had never been seen before, in any
observations.
There was no mistake about
these lights. They were seen for
four nights in succession, so that it
was impossible that they could
have been produced by conditions
of the earthly or Martian atmos
pheres or have been optical delu
eions ot any kind. Wnen first
seen at the Lick observatory, these
lights in a triangle so astonished
the astonomers that they believed
them to be the effect of light uncon
nected with the planet. They
therefore, with true astronomical
caution, waited until the following
night before devoting much thought
to the lights. On the second night,
however, which was even more
clear and brilliant than the first,
the lights were Been to be there
when the great polished lens was
turned upon the orb which had
itepped to its place in the sky.
For two succeeding evenings
after that these lights were ob
served, burning steadily, brilliantly
and effulgently, as if from three
mountain tops. It was evident
that the lights were placed upon
mountains in Mars or artificial
projections or elevations of some
kind.
The appearance of three brilliant
lights in a triangle upon one of tbe
plaiiets in a manner the astrono
mers are unable to explain raises a
presumption at which their minds
recoil. A scientist would, when
thoroughly convinced of the exist
ence of these light under such con
ditions as are known to prevail in
Mars, easily glide to the almost
irresistible conclusion that they
were the work of the men on
MarB.
Observed at any other time
there would be apparently no other
mean of explaining these lights in a
way satisfactory to common sense
Observed at the present time, whon
eminent men in science have
reached the conclusion that the
people on Mars would seize tho
opportunity to try again to attract
the attention of people on the earth
the three lights on Mars are as
significant as the moving lights in
the diBtanco were to Columbus on
his caravel.
Hut tho the three strange lights
which have looked down tho 3b
incli tube of the Lick telescope for
four successive nights and astound
ed the astronomers at the other end
art- not the only unusual appear
ances upon the surface of the
planet which the great piece of
Hint glass has revealed. That
glass, which cost over $50,000 and
at
took years to select, grind and
polish until perfection was attained,
has re waled things which other
observatories have not noticed dur
ing the present opposition.
The people of Mars being able to
bridge this globe which we call
Earth so close to them that they
can see forests, fields and cities, if
indeed, they cannot actually see
people walking on the streets,
would be eager to establish com
munication with us. They may
have tried to do this for centuties
at each recurring opposition of
Mars, or opposition of the Earth,
as they would call it, and repeated
failures would only stir them to
greater efforts.
The light» suddenly went out,
though, at different times of the
four nights when they were seen.
It almost seemed as if they were
supplied by an electric current and
as if the current had been shut off,
so suddenly did they disappear.
Amazement struck the observers
when first the lights went out.
They reflected that, of course, the
lights were some atmospheric effect
on the rim of Mar* and the very
fact of their strange disappearance
tended to prove this. The next
night, however, the three Btrange
lights flashed out in the same
place as soon as darkness had set
in and after showing steadily for a
few hours they vanished.
SchiaparelU was the first person
to give definite basis upon which
to rest the belief that Mars was
inhabited by a highly civilized
race. He discovered that the sur
face of the planet was intersected
by a large number of canals.
Primarily, Flammarion based
his theory upon that of Schiaparelli
and the two run in together in
many places, being to a large ex
tent identical. He showed plainly
that there was water upon the
planet, and there was little doubt,
he said, that the inhabitants of
Mars very closely resembled those
ot the earth.
Thus, in considering the subject
of opening up communication with
the Martians Flammarion has de
voted much thought to a possible
method of signals which might be
devised upon the earth. He has
said: "A triangle, traced in lumi
nous lines on MarB* surface, each
side from twelve to fifteen kilome
tres long, would be visible from
here by the aid of our telescopes.
It follows then that a triangle,
square or circle of the dimen
sions stated, constructed upon
a vast plain of the earth by
means of luminous points, reflected
in the daytime by solar light and
ligted at night by electicity, would
be visible to the astronomers of
Mars if there are such astronomers
and if they have optical instruments
as good as our own.
Tracing this illustration still fur
ther, Flammarion has said:
"The logical sequence is simple.
If we were to see a triangle con
structed on Mars we would be con
siderably puzzled, but if we were
to see it change first into a square
and then into a circle we would
think with some reason that such
figures reveal without question the
presence of a geometrician upon
the neighbor world. The question
however, now arises, what object
our brethren could have in forming
these figures. Why Bhould not the
inhabitants of Mars be as curious
as we are, more intelligent perhaps,
more elevated in their aspirations,
less hampered than we are in the
mire of material needs? Why
should they not suppose that the
earth is inhabited as well a» their
own world, and why should not the
object of these geometrical appeals
be to ask ub whethes whether we
exist? It is not difficult to reply.
They show us a triangle; we pro
duce it here. They trace a circle;
imitate it, and lo! communication
is established.</text>

        <text>THE MARTIAN FORESTS
VERIFIED BY OBSERVATIONS AT
THE LOWELL OBSERVATORY.
Remarkable Evidence of the Passase
of tbe Seaoni, Foliase Changing
from Green to Yellovr.
Flagstaff (Ariz.) Letter in New York
Herald.
Since our communication to the Herald
regarding the doubling of the Ganges, two
other canals on Mars have begun to show
double the Phison and the Euphrates. The
importance of this observation lies in the
fact that such duplication was precisely
what theory led us to expect would occur.
It is six weeks since the Ganges showed
double at a time and in a manner parallel
ing its appearances at the last apposition.
The Phison and Euphrates are now in HXe
manner counterpartlng their behavior of
two years ago.
Nor is this all. The surface of the planet,
both in the light and the dark regions is
undergoing the same metamorphosis It did
then. In other words, the seasonal changes
observed in the last Martian year are re
peating themselves in this one. That these
seasonal changes are the effect of vegeta
tion upon the planet we showed then to be
almost certainly the fact. The observations
of this year help to confirm our deduction.
The seasonal history of the two succes
sive Martian years thus paralleling itself
Is in detail most interesting to witness. Wre
will begin with the behavior of the Syrtis
Major and then pass on to that of the
double canals. The Syrtis Major is the
most important of the dark areas on the
planet. It ia a curious funnel-shaped mark
ing, large toward the south, and contract
ing steadily northward till It comes to an
end in two canals that curve respectively
east and west away from it, forming the
Astapus and the Nilosyrtis.
It Is historically of great interest, because
it was the first marking Identified with cer
tainty on the planet by Huygens, in 1659,
and by its identification first enabled the
planet's rotation period to be found. It
was then and long afterward believed to
be a great sea or ocean, Its blue-green col
or seeming to render this a most probable
supposition. More minute examination has
now, as we have said, rendered It practi
cally certain that it Is, in fact, not an
ocean at all, but the largest fertile region
on the planet's surface, its blue-green hue
being due to vegetation, leaves and trasses,
or whatever relatives of such may consti
tute the Martian flora.
The following account of its successive
appearances will show the reader the rea
sons upon which this deduction of its char
acter is based. Early in the Martian year
the planet's southern hemisphere, the Syr
tis Major, and the great contiguous dark
area, under the same name, to the south,
and now more commonly known as the
Tyrrhenium, presents the appearance of one
nearly uniform blue green surface. The
only discernible diversities in it are the
deeper tint of its northern end, the com
paratively narrow neck of the funnel and
of two long bands which join it to the polar
sea, traversing about sixty degrees of lati
tude in order to do so. These bands are of
a deeper color than the rest of the region,
but not so dark aa the bottom of the Syrtis
itself.
THE SEASONS ON MARS.
Such is the appearance during the spring
months, and such it continues to be into
what corresponds In the Martian calendar
to our May and June. After the summer
solstice of the Martian southern hemi
sphere, when the season passes from its
June into its July, the extreme southern
parts of the dark area fade and turn stead
ily from a deep blue green to a fainter one
and then into an orange ochre.
Shortly after this there appears in the
Syrtis Major itself strange mottllngs, Curi
ous causewaylike appearances and rhom
boidal areas of a perceptibly lighter tint
than their surroundings. These then change
further from a faint blue green to an
orange ochre, just as happened before in
the parts of the surface further south.
These causeways, as we may designate
them tor distinction, are very singular
looking marks indeed. They stretch from
the so-called continental bright areas of
the planet over to the so-called islands to
the south, and look precisely as if they
were actual causeways connecting the two.
There are a great many of them all around
the planet. In the rejfion we are now re
viewing there are two, both of them strik
ing and peculiar Soils Pons and Lunae
Pons, the former joining Hammonis Cornu,
the great cape on the west side of the Sjrr
tis, to the northern end of Hellas, 4he lat
ter connecting In like manner the Circe
Promontorium, the cape on the east side of
the Syrtis, with Hellas. They both reach
Hellas at almost, if not exactly, the same
point.
These two curious links between light re
gions were first seen in 1894, about the tenth
of the Martian July.
To understand the significance of their
apppearance this year we must note the
time of the Martian year, owing to the dlf
fr.rr.nt snepds with which the earth and
Mars revolve about the sun. The earth
otrtakes Mars once in about two years
and two months. Such meetings are called
oppositions, because the planet is then seen
In the opposite part of the sky from the
sim. Now, as the periods of the two plan
ets are not exact multiples of each other.
Mars has made, like the earth, about two
of its months more than a revolution since
the two planets met. In consequence we
see him at a time about two months later
in his year, with his reasons corresponding
lv advanced.
Thus, when observations began this year,
it was not. in Martian time about the 1st
of May, but about the 1st of July. Now
as eoon as the planet was looked at there
was the Lunae Pons distinctly visible. It
appears singularly enough in the very first
drawing made, on July 23. Our July, this
Is, for it may be well to caution the reader
to xeep the two calendars distinct. Close
as ihe two dates of detection are for the
two Martian years, it is quite possible that
the phenomena required even nearer the
same Martian date than this. For, in the
first place, owing to the rotation of the
planet the same side of his surface is not
presented to the earth favorably for ob
servation but for a part of each forty
days, and it may therefore very well hap
pen that an event taking place at the
beginning of this observational gap may
not be noticed as having happened till the
end of it.
MR. LOWELL'S OBSERVATION.
In the next place different observers dif
fer in what they must readily perceive, and
it so chanced that the observer, Mr. Lowell,
who first saw the Lunae Pons on both oc
casions had not observed at just that Mar
tian time. It is Interesting to note that
these causeways are apparently optically
connected with Mr. Douglass's canals In
the dark regions, the one probably lying
alongside the other. In addition to the
causeways are the rhomboidal and other
bright areas that seasonably arise in the
Syrtis. Like the causeways, they have
made their anpearance after the summer
solstice of the southern hemisphere at both
oppositions.
Very curious features they are. One
called Oenotria, looking like a long sand
bar left high and dry on the receding of
the tide, is on the western coast of the
Syrtis and separated from Aeria by a deep
blue green canal. It is, however, not an
inundation or tide, but parching, that in all
probability produces the metamorphosis we
detect. The growth that in the heyday of
its springtime looks so green, quickened
by the water liberated from the south polar
cap, has by the first of its July passed into
the sere and yellow leaf.
The speed with which It undergoes Its
changes Is doubtless due to the greater
aridity of Mars, the water not being suffi
cient in amount to keep it longer alive.
That all this was vegetal, not marine, is
pretty conclusively shown, for the theory
that the so-called seas should show differ
ent tints implies that they were shallow
enough to be seen through a highly im
probable supposition on the face of it. That
they changed from blue green to orange
ochre over hundreds of square miles im
plies, on the supposition that they areseas,
an immense transference of water, which
would occasion a corresponding darkening
of other regions. No such corresponding
darkening took place.
Thirdly, that Mr. Douglass found them
traversed by dark lines is quite Incompat
ible with an aquatic character. Lastly, that
Professor Pickering, with the pclariscope,
found the only certain body of water on
the planet, the polar sea, to show evi
dence of being such, while the so-called
seas showed none, is further conclusive as
to their character.
From the dark areas we pass to the light
ones. Beside the Syrtis Major, to the west,
lies. Aerla. It 13 here that are to be found
the Phison and the Euphrates. During the
Martian spring this great light area is to
our present telescopic power one vast
blank, a huge desert no more, no less.
THE POLAR SEA.
When the advancing warmth has un
locked the polar snow and let the water
find its way, aerially and otherwise, to the
equator, strange lines begin to make their
appearance athwart this desert. Two of the
most conspicuous of them start from the
middle of the southern side of ihe desert
and run dlvergingly the one a little to the
east, the other a little to the west of north
down to the Nilosyrtis.
The eastward one is the Phison; the west
ward the Euphrates.
In this singleness of look and Intent each
continues until about the 1st of August,
Martian time, when two lines begin to
show where one showed before two lines
exactly paralleling the originals in posi
tion and direction. Indefinite at first, the
twin lines gain distinctiveness as time goes
on apparently solely by darkening, until
at last the doubling Is unmistakable, and
the two resemble nothing on earth so fiuch
as the twin rails of a railroad track.
All tlls happened two years ago at the
proper reason of the Martian year, and it
is all happening at the corresponding one
now. At the present moment the lines are
evidently double, but not very dark. The
duplication is following the example of the
Ganges in order of time, just as it did then.
The details of the process are curious
and suggestive. At the points where these
lines, which are almost spiderlike in tenu
ity, leave the dark regions there appear'
what look like nicks In the contour of the
edge of the desert. Wherever there are
canals there are nicks, and where there
are double canals there are double nicks.
Now, these nicks are more conspicuous
when well seen than the canals themselves,
although when not well seen the canals
are more easily detected, as long blurs,
because of their length.
Furthermore, they make their appear
ance apparently rather before the canal
Itself. Double nicks were seen where the
double canals start in 1S94. The same
double nicks at the confines of the deserts
are visible now.
What they are is one of the most inter
esting problems before us. They are prob
ably a sort of relay station for the water
on Its way from the canals in the dark,
region Into, those in the light.
Of the oases it is not our purpose to how
speak, although they, too, have made their
appearance Just as they appeared two years
ago. The significant point of the whole is
that the seasonal phenomena of the Mar
tian year are repeating themselves at this
present one, even to details. Tl at Mars is
not only a living world, but a very orderly
one to boot, is pretty conclusively shown
by the phenomena.</text>

Mill*
THE
fessor Edward S. Morse, curatorof the
department of Japanese pottery at the
Boston Museum of Fine Arts, says the
Boeton Herald.
Professor Morse, while not an astron
omer by profession, has made a special
study of Mars for many years. Hi
new bo6k, '"'Mars and It Mystery,"
which appeared early in October, con
tains some astonishing revelations
about our next-door neighbor in the
solar system.
Professor Morse thinks the inhabi
tants of Mara may raise tobacco exten
sively. The Martians may be even
greater smokers than the men. of the
earth. How Professor Morse got this
idea is best explained in his own
words.:
"At certain times there has been ob
served in the equatorial region of Mars
a number of white spots, which have
greatly puzzled the student of Mars,
and for which no explanation has yet
been- offered. That they are not clouds
is seen in the fact that they do not
move or drift. Furthermore, these
white spots are fixed features of the
region, as they appear in the same
places.. ._,.:._
'.'It might "Ke* suggested "that they
represent snow-capped elevations or
mountain peaks, but this is difficult to
believe, as an examination of the ter
minator of Mars reveals no evidences
of -high elevations. These white spots
appear only in midsummer, which
would argue against their being snow
caps, as in midsummer they would cer
tainly melt and disappear. The time
of their appearance coincides with the
time of greatest equatorial heat.
"Since the appearance of these
white spots in Mars corresponds with
the period of greatest evaporation, it
is conceivable that an intelligence in
Mars might utilize the same method
which has recently been adopted in
Connecticut and Porto Rico in the
raising of tobacco, namejy, to protect
the fields with white cotton cloth."
It is the canals of Mars, however,
that furnish Professor Morse with the
strongest evidence of life on the red
planet. On this point he quotes Pro
fessor Pcrcival Lowell of Boston, who
has made more extensive obrervations
of the Martian canals than any other
astronomer. He says:
"What we see hints of the existence
of beings who are in advance of, not
behind, us in the -journey of life."
Problems of a Dying World.
A peculiar interest is excited in these
superior beings because they have
grappled with the problems of a dying
world. They have learned how to ex-,
ist on a desert planet where water is
the scarcest and most precious thing in
existence. Their whole world is much
like the Sahara desert, or the flat des
ert plain of our own Arizona.
Yet on a dried-up world of this -sort
they evidently have built up and con
tinue to maintain a civilization far in
advance of anything on the earth. This
is indicated by the complex canal sys
tem that prevails all over their globe.
One of their canals alone is over 3,000
miles in length, long enough to reach
from Boston to San Francisco. In
deed, canals on Mars seem to be
aswiths
numerous as railroads on the earth.
Professor Morse has made a drawing
showing how similar some parts of our
network of railroads are to the Martian
canal lines. The canals of Holland also
present a similarity. These illustra
tions are set forth to show that such
markings must be the works of intelli
gent beings rather than the haphazard
cracks or markings of nature. Profes
sor Morse sums up the argument in fa
vor of the Martian canals being arti
ficial in these words:
"The unnatural straightness of these
interlacing lines on Mars, many of
them following the arcs of great cir
cles their unilorm width thruout, their
always starting from definite areas, their
convergence to common centers, find
no parallel in natural phenomena.''
Where these canals meet one another
are circular areas, indicating great
oases, and probably large cities.
Professor Morse gained much of the
material for this book by a visit to
the southwest. He spent five weeks at
Professor Lowell's observatory at Flag
staff, Ariz. In the dry, steady, clear
air, 7,000 feet above sea level, ho
studied the surface of Mars thru a
telescope. He saw the pale yellow disk
of the planet gradually develop a net
work of dark markings. I was like
a photographic plate, first blank and
then mysteriously taking on shades and
lines.till a world picture was presented.
Looking about him in that desert re
gion, Professor Morse found an explan
ation of the Martian mystery.
Explanation of the Martian Mystery.
"Let one stand on some peak of the
Verde mountains," he said, "northeast
from Phoenix, Ariz., overlooking the
Gila river as it follows its course across
the desert, and after the river is lost
to view he will notice that the foliage
/long its banks marks its course.

"If one $ake$ this view in" winter
time, the ui=iform gray of the plains,
Unbroken by^fe-shade of color, blends
with the lightsbitt^.of the distant Plo
mas and Ca&tle.Dome mountains on the
southwest horizon. In the early spring,
when the water is first let into the
irrigating channels, with their innumer
able divergent ditches, a, shade of green
may be seen emerging from the monot
onous yellow-gray of the hot and ster
ile plain, first conspicuous near the
source of the water supply, and then
following along to Phoenix, Temple and
other regions, till in full efflorescence
these cities stand out like great green
carpets spread upon the earth.
From this mountaintop not a trace
of an irrigating ditch, large or small,
would be discerned, except here and
there a glint, of reflected sunlight, but
the effects of the life-giving waters can
be traced in broad bands to the re-?
motest limits of the water channels,
when they would end as abruptly as
they had begun."
Professor Morse makes this explana
tion to illustrate how wide areas of
vegetation may be seen at a great dis
tance, so great, indeed, that canals
themselves would be invisible. The
canals of Mars are believed to be gi
gantic irrigating ditches, very similar
to those now in operation in the'west
and those being constructed by.tbe-govr
eminent.
As life on Mars appears to be sus
tained solely by irrigation, it would
seem that its inhabitants. are great ag
riculturists. We are only beginnings to
learn how to produce vegetation and
sustain life on deserts. But the. Mar
tian have covered their whole globe
irrigation works. Professor
Morse thinks they must understand the
principles-of hydraulics far better than
our best civil engineers.,
Their sole source of water supply
seems to be the snow caps that- form
at the poles during the winter. When
these snowcaps begin to melt, the wa
ter is conducted by the canals clear
down to the equator, and probablv
every drop of it conserved and used
over and over again for irrigating the
land.
Inhabitants of the Planet. .,V'
What manner of beings these are
that have created such a prodigious,
universal waterworks system is a mys
tery. Professor Morse appears to
think they may be like men or gigan
tic ants. For men and ants, he ob
serves, exist at the greatest extremes
of elevation, where the air is heaviest
and rarest, as well as in places where
the climate is hottest and coldest.
On Mars the air is exceedingly/rare,
about half the density of the atmos
phere on the highest mountain tops of
the earth. A man from the earth sud
denly transported there, Professor
Morse thinks, would give a few gasps
and die. But the rarefaction of the
air has taken place by very slow de
grees, and for this reason Professor
Morse conjectures that man might sur
vive the change. He says on this point:
"One has only to make himself fa
miliar with the wide range of. cond^
tions under which life in various forms
exists on the earth to realize that the
introduction of Martian" conditions here
would not be such an overwhelming
calamity. If these conditions could be
introduced by minute increments cover
ing thousands of centuries, it' is not
unreasonable to believe that myriads
of forms would survive the change
and among those that survive would be
precisely th$ kinds that thrive under
the most diverse conditions here, name-

ly, man and the higher hymenoptera,
the ants."
We have the choice, then, of consid
ering the Martian either a man or gi
gantic being,, adapted to breathing the
rarefied air, or a mammoth ant. Pro
fessor Morse seems to lean to the idea
that a creature very like man is theof
Martian intelligent being.
What Martians Might Say of Us.
One of the most interesting parts
of Professor Morse's book is the chap
ter on "What the Martians Might Say
of Us," which begins:
"For every single perplexity of inter
pretation we encounter in our study of
the surface markings of Mars the Mar
tian would encounter a dozen perplexi
ties in interpreting the various features

come to the conclusion that no creature
could possibly exist on the earth. Tho
tremendous force of gravitation and
atmospheric pressure would forbid the
existence of organic forms. Life, if it
existed, must have legs of iron to sus
tain its weight, and a crust like a turtle
to be impervious to the force of rain
drops, and this.wouldbe contrary to all
Martian analogy..

anced as to temperature, the. earth, be

too hot for lire to exist. The Martian
considers our year too short. In his

        <text>WILL THE NEW YEAR SOLVE THE RIDDLE OF MARS?
ANOTHER and tmal message from
Mars trill soon be in general
hand. If not epoch making as
a milestone of astronomy, it is
the moFt absorbing and extraor
dinary word on an ever fascinating
subject that has bee-n spoken since
Sehiaparelll first discussed the inhabit
ubillty of Mar* aloud. For Professor
Pcrclval Lowell, our greatest M.'.rtlan
student, now declare* positively and
without reservation that our nearest
planetary neighbor is not only alive
with vegetation made possible by
means of vast artificial canals, but is
peopled by an order of beings In many
respects quite superior to ourselves!
In other words, Professor Lowell has
solved, at U-ast to his own satisfaction,
the greatest riddle of the ages — the ex
isfnep of life in another world!
Since 1877, when Sehiaparelll aston
ished laymen and astronomers by an
nouncing the discovery of the Martian
«.anals, etar gazers have kept their eyes
focused upon th« face of the red maned
planet. Acres of white, paper have been
covered with notes of whst they saw.
And. finally, Profrssor Lowell and his
aids at the Flagstaff observatory suc
ceeded in actually photographing the
Martian canals. His new volunio, 1s-
Mi.-,i by the Macmillan Company, Ik the
first formal announcement of his recent
«i!(srrvatlonß «.nd conclusions that has
horn published. Not only in hln verdict
liipliiy revolutionary from a scientific
viewpoint, but It is no lc«e daring tlian
convincing when v|pw*d Impartially.
Stupendous ax the conclusion is from
t'to facts presented *b calmly and dis
pOßsionately by Professor Lowell, we
arc nou 1 actually Introduced to b'-ings
oaj Mtr« resembling ourselves In many
«'?»entla.l features.
owlnr. for instance, to the vast d*s
<it areas there — to the uttf r absence of
water on most of the surface — It Is
reasonable to suppose that the Martian
means of transportation are other than
our own. For the people must com
municate with one another, since. Pro
feasor Lowell is convinced, water from
the poles Is distributed among the pop
ulous oases hundreds and thousands of
miles apart. And the only possible
agency, in view of the physical flatness
of the planet and of the fact that the
force of gravity at any distance from
the eonter of Mars is only one-tenth
the gravity toward the center of the
«>«rth at the same distance, is artificial.
If. In other words, our force of gravity
its represented by 100. It !« only 27 on
Mars, co-nslflerlny that Mars is only .63
the size of the onrth. There our pound
would weigh only about six ounces, and
it Martian of human «ixe murt be more
than twtre as strong as the. average
man here. ' •
Without indulging In mental aero
nautics on* reaches the logical conclu
sion that aerial navigation 1* the easl
rrt and most reasonable means of
transportation for our etarry neigh
bors. Indeed, it if not improbable that
they are equipped, granting their ex
istence, with such knowledge of nat
ure! forces, or euoh physical attributes,
as may enable them to propel tliem
erjves from place to place as would our
own mechanical birds. Following are
tho salient feature* in this amazing
message from Mare:
Professor Lowell
«-|— HAT Mars is Inhabited by beings
I of one sort or another w? may con
sider as certain. The theory of an
existent Intelligent life there may be
likened to the atomic theory in chem
istry: tho behavior of chemle com
pounds points to the existence of atoms
too 'email for u» to see. and in the same
way the aspect and behavior of the
Martian markings Imply the action of
agents too far away, as yet, to be dis
cerned.
Though In neither case ran we tell
anything of the bodily manifestation,
we can, In both, affirm a good deal about
their workings. Girdling Mars, for ex
ample, and stretching from pole to
pole, the Martian canal system not
only embraces their whole world,* but
is an organized entity. Each canal
Joins another, which in turn connects
with a third, and co on over the entire
surface of the planet This continuity
of construction proves a community
of Interest; and when we consider that,
though not «o large ac the earth, the
world, of Mars Is 4200 miles in diam
eter. and contains something like 212,
000,000 square miles, the unity of the
process acquires considerable signifi
cance. The eupposod vast enterprises
of the earth are. dwarfed by .compari
son, being merely as a civic subway
compared with one of continental pro
portions.
The first thing that is forced on us In
carefully studying conditions on the
planet Is the necessarllyMntelllgent and
peaceful character of the community
which could thus act as a unit through
out its globe. War is a survival
among us from savage times, and af
fects chiefly the boyish and unthinking
element of the cation. The wls«st
realize that there are better ways" for
practicing heroiFiri and other and more
certain means of insuring the survival
of the fittest. War is something a
people outgrow. But, whether they
consciously practice peace or not, na
ture In Ite evolution practices it for
them, . "
Whether Increasing common, sense cr

drove the Martians tp this 'eminently

Instead of showing blue-sreen. as

place shortly after the winter solstice
at that part of the planet Two months
passed and then the chocolate hue van
ished—one as it had come. The oul
minatlon of the change seems to Have
taken place about sixty days after the
southern winter solstice, or in tne
depths of the Martian winter to that
hemisphere. This is certainly Just the
time when vegetation should be dead
est. The lowest point of the blue-green
tint was reached about January 33 for
the northern and February 8 for the
southern part, which Indicates that the

the same day after day throughout
the year. In hue they range from sand
color to brick red, and it is to the lat
ter that the fiery . tint' of Mars is lup.
They are unquestionably desert areas.
The pale salmon hue, which reproduces
best in drawings, is that which our
own deserts wear. The Sahara ii^
this. look; still more, it finds its conn-?
terpart in the far aspect of the Painted
Desert of Northern Arizona. To onu
standing on the summits of the Fan
Francisco peaks and gazinsr off from
that isolated height upon thi3
other desolation of aridity the resem
blance to the telescopic, tints of this
Martian globe Is striking.
In other \u25a0words, , the gradual en
croachment of desert areas on earth
finds a parallel in Mars, excepting that,
pitiless as our deserts ar?, they arc but
faint forecasts of the state of things
on Mars today. *
From the detection of the main
markings on the planet surface we now
pass to a discovery so unprecedented
that the scientific world was at first
loth to accept it— that of the canals.
Not everybody can- see these delicate
lines at first sight, even when pointed
ont to them. When viewed under* the
best conditions, however, the disk of
th"c planet takes on a most singular
appearance. It looks as if it had been
cobwebbed all over — a. mesh of nno
lines which., with ( attention, proves to
compass tho globe from one pole to the
other. ~~
It Is due wholly to the lack of suit
able conditions-that the true form; of
the Martian lines is usually missed.
Given the proper prerequisites of loca
tion or of,eye, and their pencil mark
peculiarly stands forth unmistakably
confessed. The sole method of esti
mating their width is by comparison
of effect with a wire of known size at a
Known distance. For this purpose a
telegraph wire was stretched against
the sky at Flagstaff, and the observers,
going back upon the mesa, observed
and recorded its appearance as their,
stations': grew remote, it proved sur- v
prising at what great distances a alewwf
"der'wire could be made out wheff thua
projected against the sky. The wire in
the experiment was but .0728 of an
inch in diameter and yet could be seen
with certainty at a distance of igoo
feet, at which point Its diameter sub
tended only .69 of a second of are. How
small this is may be appreciated from
its taking more than ninety such lines
laid side by side to'make a width divis
ible iby the eye. Theoretically, then a
line three-fourths of. a mile wide on
Mars-would be visible to us through
our powerful:telescopes.-
But we will take a mile or two safety
as the smallest width for one of the
lines.. The greatest waa got by com
paring what is by far the largest of the
canals, - the- NUosyrtls. with the mi
crometer thread. From such determin
ation'lt appeared that this' canal was
from twenty-flye to thirty miles wide,
while,the smallest may be fixed as be
ing from i two to three miles in width
On:the other hand, their length is rela
tively-enormous. Two thousand* miles

. , ilany interesting theories about
i hi tte life of Mars have been put
iafc forward, but all of them have been
jb open to some objection. Professor
Laa : Percival Lowell, of the Flagstaff
' Obaervatory in Arizona, has argued
1(y9 that the so-called canals of Mars sire
sflr1 . vast engineering works, and con
5," ' cequently that the inhabitants who
ffyti bailt thera were of great intellectual
lajfeij development. The scientific novel-
m'?M H G- Wel,B' bas builL an ox-
$f-2m tremely interesting story ou the
basis Hint the Martians are octopus
like creatures, without bony struc
ture, but possessed of highly devel
oped brains. A common assumption of
many speculators has been that
the Martians are extremely at
tenuated creatures, because the
slight pressure of gravity on the
surface of the planet would favor
this form.
Now a new and exceedingly inter
esting theory concerning the life
on Mars has been put forward by
Professor William Wallace Camp
bell, of the great Lick Observatory,
California. He suggests that all
life ou Mars has taken a vegetable,
form.
ThlK. -ttfGory Is one of the most
plausible that bns been put
forward. It has the support of all
the facts about Mars that have been
scientifically established and it
avoms many of the improbabilities
involved In other theories on the
same 3ubjecL t
The vegetation theory rests pri
marily on the fact proved by spec
troscopic analysis that there is an
enormous proportion of carbonic
acid gas In the atmosphere of Mars
which would make animal ijfG n'f.
the kind known to the earth er
coedingly dllfleull, if not impossible,
while it would greatly favor the
development of vegetation.
Before considering this theory
.further, we must bear in mind a
few of the proved facts about Mars.
It has atmosphere, seasons, land,
wator. storms, clouds and moun
tains. It also rains and snows on
Mars, as it does with us. Great
white patches appear periodically
upon Its surface. These may be
accumulations of snow and they
have also been called "eyes." Their
nature will be discussed later.
When Mars approaches nearest to
the earth it is. seen to. have a. bright
rod color and sometimes looks like
a red lamp in the sky. It has been
suggested that the vegetation for
tho most part Is yellow or orange
instead of green, as with us, thus
giving the planet its color.
Mars has two moons, the near
est of which Is but 3,700 miles away
and revolves around the planet in
seven hours and a half, showing
all the phases of our moon in one
night.

The atmosphere and

very slight, and tho in
habitants, if there bo
any, must find life a dif
ficult problem there.
The water Is confined
entirely to the poles,
whore it is deposited
annually In the form of
a thin lawyor of snow
or hoar frost, only to
melt away again 'with
tho adveut of Summer.
Ages ago life on Mars
must havo concentrated
ItselC ou the problem
of dovlslug some means
whereby tho melting
water of the polar
parts might be con
ducted to those arid re
gions of the temperate
nnd torrid zones,
which would still
blossom if water-
ed. Here .we may
note one of the
strongest arguments tn favor of the
vegetation theory of life.
Professor Lowell has argued that
the canals of Mars, first discovered
by Professor Scbiaparelli, of Milan,
but long considered optical Illusions
by mauv astronomers, are the ir
rigation " works of the inhabitants.
The canals are singularly artificial
in appearance. They extend toward
the equator from the poles and
cover tho planet like a fine. netting.,
Each caual -is tho- shortest dls-.
lance, between two points and in
variably runs to a pclnt called "an
oasis." where it meets other cauals
not lu haphazard fashion, but ac
cording -to some plan.
The "canals" vary in longth from
2r0 miles to over 3,000
miles, a length that is astonishing
when it is considered that thv
diameter of Mars is only 4,220
miles. All told, Professor Lowell
has plotted -137 of tbeso canals and
1S6 oases. It was Professor Pick
ering, a close associate of Profcsso.
Lowell, who first saw these oases
Thc canals of Mars appear am!
disappear with the seasons. In
other words they slowly creep dowu
from the poles encb Spriug and
slowly retreat with tho approach of
Winter. If thc canals are artlficla.
In origin, this phenomenon would
appear to mean that the Martians
are busily engaged in digging stu
pendous canals, only to fill them up
again every year.
Professor Pickering Ingeniously
avoided this embarrassing conclu
sion by pointing out that we see
not the canals themselves, but tho
vegetation which friuges their
banks and thus indicates their
com sc. Vegetation must grow be
fore I lie canol3 aro lsiblo and must
disappear before the cauals vanish.
Here we can see why the theory
that all the life ou Mars is vege
tation is more probable than any
other. Professor Pickering admits
that tho sigus of life we see arc
vegetable, but suggests that then
are the work of man-like creature"
whom we cannot see. But we knu .

earth which do posses3 a kind of

reasonable to believe that they
would have developed an intelli
gence at least equal to that of mnn
if conditions h3d been favorable.
Such conditions have prevailed on
Mars. Chief among th m Is an at
mosphere very favorable, to plant
Ufo and very unfavorable to animal
life. .
There are on the earth many
carnivorous plants which though
unmistakably vegetable in form pos
sess many of the powera of animals.
These plants Include the butcher
plant, pitchor plant, the sundew,
the butter wort and, many other
forms. They range from plants
that eat Insects to those that are
capable of devouring birds and
small mammals.
The pitcher plant, for Instance, has
a heavy flesh leaf ten inches long.
With the spiked point of the leal
it strikes a rat, numbing it with
the poison it contains. Then the
lear folds over the animal and it Is
absorbed into 'the body of the plant
and digested.

Due to the very rare Martian. atmosphere the
Martian's chest moat be enormous to accommodate
his ponderout lungs, necessary to supply his
oxygen. Rare atmosphere conducts sound very
poorly, hence the large ears, necessary'to catch the
very weak sounds. Due to the poor atmosphere it
ia exceedingly cold on Mara, except at (he equator.
Hence Martians are covered with a white polar fur
from head to foot A rare atmospheris conducts
odors but poorly, hence die elephantine nose, which
goes to die odor, as the odor can't come to the
Martian.

hence the big feet. The tremendously civilized
Martian always rides or flies from place to place;
his lags are tiros almost .melees, hence devoid of

The Martian stopped all physical work millions

are weak and thin. But the hands and eyes?the
Martian's moat important organs, are used and
worked constantly?hence are developed wonder

the? do, they probably think that all of
out acta are due to "Instinct." In their way
they are probably right It depends only
upon the point of view.
But given like conditions evolution will
progress alike In widely separated spheres.
The Indians on the American Continent
developed about the same as the Euro
peans, although they had not intermingled
for thousands of years. It is not even ab
solutely certain that they have not sprung
into being on their own accord.
Following this line of reasoning?and the
writer admits it may be all wrong?there
Is a strong chance that the Martian has de
veloped In s manner similar to that of man
on earth. As a matter of fact, the chances
are greaJy In Its favor. If w? grant this
truth. It should be easy to form a mental
picture of the Martian under his present
unfavorable conditions upon his planet.
To begin with, the Martian race, millions
of years older tuan the terrwitrlal, must
have advanced tremendously. The Mar
tian's head, due to his greatly developed
brain, must be enormous. On account of
the low gravitational force on Mars, where
his body is pulled downward with only one
third of the weight as that on earth, the
Martian must be of great height. He is at
least ten or twelve feet tall. Geotropism
on earth proves this amply.
To support such a tall body where grav
ity is so small, better footing Is necessary,
hence the big (eet are required. The tre
mendously civilized Martian always rides
or flies from [la to place; his legs are
thus Mnjpst unless. Just l'u* a sto'V's, for

sinewy.
Due to the very rare Martian atmos
phere, the Martian's cheat must be enor
Pious to accommodate the ponderous
lungs which are necessary to supply air
and oxygen to his large body. On the
other hand, rare atmosphere conducts
sound very poorly, hence large ears are
required to catch the exceedingly weak
sounds.
As already mentioned, due to the poor
atmospl^ere, it is exceedingly cold on Mars,
except at the equator. Even here it is
freezing. Hence Martians are probably
oovered from head to foot with a white
polar fur. A rare atmosphere conducts
odors but rocly. We thus nay expect the
man on Mars to have an elephantine nose,
which goes to the odor, as the odor can't
com* to the Martian.
The Martian must certainly have
stopped all bodily work millions of years
ago; machines have done his work for
ages. His arms thus are weak and thin.
But the hands and eyes?the Martian's
most Important organs?are used and
worked constantly and therefore are de
veloped to an undreamed of degree.
He probably has six or more fingers on
his hands Even on earth we have already
?ix-flngered human beings.
His eyes probably can be extended from
their sockets at the end of a sort of ten
tacle, the same as a snail's. This gives the
Martian a larger range of vision, without
the trouble of moving his head about As

form and as he cannot talk, the Martian's

This statement need not be ridiculed.
Certain animals, each as our ants, havo a
highly developed telepathic orean. Stu
dents of ants know that the killing of one
ant will be Immediately sensed by others,
although ten or more feet distant. And
within a few seconds they will hare ar

The possibility that Mars is inhabited
by strange creatures like that pictured on
this page it itrengthened by the fact that
in other parts of the universe life persists
under the moat extreme conditions imag
inable. Certain species of fish may be
frozen stone hard for days, and will revive
after thawing out.
Thirty years ago it was strenuously de
nied that there could be living creatures
at the bottom of the ocean, where such

The history of evolution throughout na
ture shows Invariably that antmai life Is
the direct product of Its environment. h>
order to survive, nature equips each animal
with the necessary organs best edited for
its particular environment. Thus the ca

color of the leaves on which he feasts

Such a be*n(r as has

the sort of one Natura
would find *t neceesary to dezelop in order
to meet the peculiar conditions existing
on Mars.
Some Interesting comparison* given in

But in return for this reduction In his

certain compensations. He would be able

a projectile fired from Mnrs at the rate of

but would become a new satellite.

life on Our Distant Neighbor Is
"Grand, Intense, Formidable/9
Says M. Perrier
By Arnold D. Prince
IF IT should prove to be the case
after all that those mysterious
Marconi "messages" came from
Mars or even Venus, the next
problem of importance will be the
"dud of people who sent them. For,
of course, if the earth is to have new
neighbors with whom to exchange
gossip across the back yard of the
sidereal firmament, it will want to
know something about them. It will
want to know something of their
habits, appearance, how they dress,
act and possibly their views on in?
terplanetary relations. All sorts of
situations may arise wherein a
mutual understanding of personal
traits, characteristics and general
disposition will aid in establishing
and preserving amicable relations.
Signor Marconi, unfortunately,
was not able to throw much light on
the subject. Virtually all that came
within the scope of his observation
was that when prosecuting wireless '
experiments certain "signals oc?
curred'' with persistent regularity
which could not be explained on the
theory of casual interference. As '
these signals had been received
"simultanecuslv_ at New York and
London with identical intensity," he
admitted the possibility of their be?
ing attempts by the inhabitants of
fother planets to communicate"
with us.

What kind of people, then, in
i ?bit these two planots? In seek?
ing an answer to this question the
inquirer is thrown back almost ex?
clusively, of course, on the con?
clusions of the scientists who have
made a 6tudy of the subject. No
one, so far as known, is in a posi?
tion to give first hand information.
Nor is there anything specially help?
ful in such suggestions as emanated
recently from one authority, who,
when asked his opinion as to the
population on Venus, replied with
hopeful animation that they were
"chorus girls." Such jocularity is
merely beclouding the issue and add?
ing difficulties to a problem that is
difficult enough as it is.
Among scientists who have won
the righ*- to speak with authority
. the foreu?v- was the late Professor
Percival Lowell, director of the
observatory at Flagstaff, Ariz.
Professor Lowell was the brother
of Abbott Lawrence Lowell, presi?
dent of Harvard University. Be?
fore taking charge at Flagstaff he
had been attached to the observa?
tory at Harvard and had conducted
astronomical investigations in many
parts of the world, including Japan,
Tripoli, the Andes and other coun?
tries. He had delivered lectures on
his findings before important scien?
tific societies in Great Britain and
the United States.
Not only was Professor Lowell
convinced that Mars was inhabited,
but he believed the people had a
"?finch higher degree of intelligence
than those on earth. He dwelt
Particularly on their inventive
genius.
*i*eat Inventors
"Quite possibly," wrote Professor
'-owell in his book, "the Martian
[oik are possessed of inventions of
which we have not dreamed, and
"With them electrophones and kineto
scopes are things of a bygone past,
preserved with veneration in mu?
teras as relic? of the clumsy con?
trivances of the simple childhood of
the race.
'Certainly, what we see hints at
the existence of beings who are in
advance of, not behind, us in the
Journey of life.
"Startling as the outcome of
?**? observations' may appear at
-fr"*-"? in truth there ia npthing
?tartling about it whatever. Such
P?ttibility has been quite on the
??***? ?ver aince the existence of
-P*9HmM ?M -mocBisMd by the
Chaldean shepherds, or whoever the
still more primitive astronomers
may have been. Its strangeness is
a purely subjective phenomenon,
arising from the instinctive reluc?
tance of mind to admit the possi?
bility of peers. Such would be comic
were it not the inevitable conse?
quence of the constitution of the
universe. To be shy of anything
resembling himself is part and par?
cel of man's own individuality.
"Like the savage, who fears noth?
ing so much as a strange man; like
Crusoe, who grows pale at the sight
of footprints not his own, the civi?
lized thinker turns from the thought
of mind other than he himself
knows."
The peculiar relevancy of this
view to the discussion resulting from
Signor Marconi's announcement will
strike- any one who reads Professor
Lowell's statement. His brother
scientists were indeed "shy," as he
had predicted, of the deductions
reached by him, but they at least
contained the views of the Flagstaff
astronomer as to the kind of people,
who, if we accept the pleasing possi?
bility suggested by Signor Marconi,
are trying to "strike up a speaking
acquaintance" with us. Not only are
they masters in the knowledge of
electricity, but they have already
relegated to the museum of antiqui?
ties many of the discoveries in that
field which we, here on earth, look
upon as last minute achievements in
scientific effort.
Professor Lowell, while comment?
ing strongly on the intellectual at?
tainments of the Martians, made
little or no reference to the actual
appearance of the folk living on that
distant planet True, he did say in
another part of his book that they
probably were not interested in
party politics, and that, judging from
their canals, they were favored by a
"comprehensiveness" of mind much
more embracive than that "which
presided over the various depart?
ments of our own public works" in
the United States, but as politicians
look much like other persons very
little could be gained from that.
First Martian Pictures
It was M. Edmond Perrier, direct?
or of the museum of the Jardin des
Plantes, in Paris, who constructed
the first picture of the Martians, as
he conceived them.
At the time M. Perrier undertook
this task the division among the au?
thorities on Professor Lowell's the?
ory had assumed wide p reportions.
Some were decidedly "cold" to the
notion that Mars?the question as to
Venus was temporarily in eclipse?
was inhabited at all, and they con?
sidered it futile and profitless, there?
fore, to attempt to depict a non-ex?
istent people. Others, as has hap?
pened even recently, considered the
matter in a light vein, thinking to
get some humor out of it, and one
newspaper carried a cartoon, cap
tioned "Hello Central," showing Pro?
fessor Lowell "calling up" Mars.
Still another group seemed to take
it as a personal affront that the as?
tronomer had sought to enlarge their
list of acquaintances by introducing
a race about which they had abso?
lutely no knowledge.
M. Perrier approached the problem
from a highly speculative viewpoint,
but made clear the fact, nevertheless,
that he saw no reason for condemn?
ing the position of Professor Lowell.
"Dreams are not a crime," con?
tended the French scholar, "and in
this case contradiction i? difficult."
The director of the museum of
the Jardin des Plantes led up to his
description of the inhabitants of
Man by ?rtabiiahing the premia?,
that conditions on Mars are not
inimical to human life. Rain, snow,
thunder and hail are known there,
as on earth. There are seaweeds in
the ocean, grass and trees on the
land, fields available for cultivation
and a friendly soil to provide food
for the people.
"The life which animates the
earth also animates other planets,"
said the French savant. "From what
goes on around us we may divine
what is happening elsewhere by ex?
amining the exact conditions under
which each planet finds itself en
rapport with ? every other. On the
planets which are furthegt away,
it is impossible that human beings
should exist, for no organism could,
for example, be formed in the al?
kaline seas of Jupiter, while Mer?
cury, which is too near the sun,
could not engender life. Only Venus,
the Earth and Mars are habitable."
On Mars, M. Perrier went on, life
is "grand, intense, formidable." The
mean temperature is 40 degrees
Fahrenheit, as against 76 degrees
on earth, the winters are more se?
vere, the summers warmer, the year
longer and the seasons more marked
than ours.
The sea animals are, much like
ours, the fishes have a sense of hear?
ing, there are insects in the animal
kingdom and flowers and butterflies,
but the humans are very, very differ?
ent.
Before going on and giving M. Per?
ri?re picture of the kind of people
the Martians are, and in order to re
assure such sensitive souls as may I
fear to establish speaking relations I
with a people too alien in -appearance
to make acceptable neighbors, it
should be stated that M. Perrier does
not agree with the conception of the
Martians set forth by H. G. Wells in
his book "War of the Worlds." Mr.
Wells, in that work, caused the Mar?
tians to resemble cuttlefish, with
round, gray bodies, with "sort of
faces" and long, groping tentacles.
This conception, M. Perrier as?
serted, did the Martians a great in?
justice and created a prejudice
against them, which is not only un?
scientific and unsound, but entirely
undeserved.
The Martians, the French scholar
held, bear a certain resemblance to
man, although many of their fea?
tures are more prominent. For this,
the difference in the forces of grav?
ity and in environment are chiefly
responsible, he said. Their ears, for
example, are very large.
Continniug? tie? gsmtos of thai
museum of the Jardin des Plantes]
said:
. "The low atmospheric pressure
has produced a considerable devel?
opment of the pulmonary apparatus,
and consequently the general char?
acter of the Martians has been in?
fluenced by this development, which
is unknown on earth.
Why Martians Are Tall
"The men on Mars are tall be?
cause the force of gravity is slight.
They are blond, because the daylight
is less intense. They have less pow?
erful limbs. They have some of the
characteristics of our Scandinavian
type, although they probably have
larger skulls.
"Their large blue eyes, theii
strong noses, their large ears, con?
stitute a type of beauty which we
doubtless would not appreciate ex?
cept as suggesting superhuman in?
telligence."
Going further into details, M. Per
rier concluded that the jaw of the
Martian is narrower than ours.be
cause time and evolution have re
moved him further from his anima
forebears than they have us. His |
lung capacity is enormous because of
the thin atmosphere, although his
legs are extremely thin, due to the
little effort needed in walking. He
has little or no neck.
Touching on the question of intel?
ligence, the French savant deduced
j that ' the Martians have solved the
problem of existence, and know no
such thing as industrial strife. Be?
ing older, they are also wiser than
we. They have long since conquered
disease, and know the hour of their
demise, awaiting the event calmly.
They have overcome poverty, are
too sophisticated to engage in war,
and need no law or government to
keep them orderly. Philosophers
and brothers, they live in amity and
understanding, devoting all their
thought to the promotion of large
undertakings in which selfishness,
avarice and earthly trifles have no
part.
They are, in a word, as different
from tha ?*ncifui And unpieasing
picture painted by Wells as are we
from the Simian types referred to
by Darwin.
Returning to tho question of flora
and fauna, M. Perrier concluded
that because of the reduced force
of gravity, animals are much larger
on Mars than here, and hop, run
and fly about much more easily.
Grass is higher, fruit is bigger, and
the flowers possess undreamed of
beauty. The light is something lik?
our dusk, and the general landscape
much more attractive than on
earth.
"The year on Mars is twice as
long as our earthly one," he ex?
plained, "and hence plants and in?
sects have twice the time in whicr
to evolve. Mars is the land of hug?
plants and ideal flowers, of bird;
abnormally powerful in song an<
wondrous in appearance, and o:
four-footed animals with extraor?
dinarily developed fur and skin."
Neither M. Perrier ?or the other
scientists who believe in the habita
bility of other worlds paid so much
attention to Venus. They agreed,
however, with the head of the Jardin
des Plantes that as this planet is
much younger than the earth,
life there is much less advanced.
Because of the greater nearness to
the sun, the climate is something
like that in our tropics, and the air
is always misty. Animals and plants
are much like ours, especially at the.
poles, where the temperature is not
so high, but humans are not much
beyond the development that existed
on earth during the secondary geo?
logical period.
Not From Venus
In other words, there is much less
likelihood that those strange Marv
coni signals came from Venus than
that they came from Mars. j
Having thus disposed o? the kind j
of beings supposed to exist on the
only two eligible planets, two other
questions arise?Why are the Mar?
tians or the Venusians trying to
communicate with us, that is, if they
are? and, What atmospheric condi?
tions will we on earth have to over?
come in order to reply to them?
As to tho first question, a possible
explanation may be found in Jtha
so-called cataclysm on Mars that was
I reported by the British Astronomical
Association in 1909. In that year
the "planet of mystery" was nearer
to earth than at any time since 1892,
and so in a favorable position for
observation.
The phenomenon which was her?
alded as without parallel in the rec?
ords of the past was the appearance
of a gloomy, yellow veil which en?
shrouded immense tracts of the Mar?
tian surface, obliterating important
markings.
On account of the theory, then
recently advanced by Professor
Lowell, that Mars was inhabited, the
changes aroused extraordinary inter?
est. It previously had I*? ;i sug?
gested that the canals on the planet
had been constructed by a dying
race, a race menaced by starvation
on a desert planet, which had sought
by means of these enormous via?
ducts to carry water from t?e melt?
ing ice caps at the poles, and the
appearance of the yellow mist com?
bined with the simultaneous erasure
of some of the canal markings gave
riso to the fear that a gigantic
i
Professor Lowell Held That Mar?
tians Were Far Advanced in
Inventions and Science
catastrophe had occurred, the effects
of which were only too apparent.
Can it be, some of the observers
of conditions now are asking, that
CCIENTISTS agree that
*"* the people of Mars differ
from us in many ways. The
Martians are believed to
have very large noses and
ears and immense lung de?
velopment, because of the
rarefied atmosphere. Their
legs are poorly developed, be?
cause matter on Mars weighs
less than here and sturdy
legs are not needed to bear
their weight. Birds and but?
terflies are very large and j
beautiful
?some such similar catastrophe has j
overtaken the Martians, who, in
their desperation, are attempting to
communicate the fact to us?
In August, 1909, astronomers
working at their telescopes had re?
ported what they surmised to be a
new fracture of the southern polar
cap and the appearance of a dark
streak along the line of the break.
About the same time a brilliant spot,
which may have been a segment of
the shattered terrain, had- separated
itself from the polar cap and had
moved over to one of the dusky
areas of the planet, partly hiding it
from view.
Great Convulsion Possible
All this seemed to strengthen the
theory of a huge convulsion ad?
vanced by the British scientists, al?
though, as seems to be the fate of all
questions concerning this much dis?
cussed and little understood celes?
tial body, eminent authorities at
once took opposing ground on the
subject.
Professor Harold Jacoby, Ruther?
ford Professor of Astronomy at
Columbia University, contended that
"the Martians are not likely to have
their world destroyed any more than
are we," adding that if any such
catastrophe as hinted had actually
occurred the news would have be?
come known through some quicker
channel than the British Astro?
nomical Association. By this, it
should be explained hastily, Profes?
sor Jacoby did not mean that the
scientists across the Atlantic were
slower in observation than others,
| but only that the disaster would
have been revealed by telescopes
! everywhere long before a formal
| report could have been prepared.
Professor F. R. Moulton, of the
! University of Chicago, also doubted
the accuracy of the report, and Pro?
fessor Lowell himself, author of the
notion that Mars is inhabited, was
not particularly impressed with it. .
Professor Lowell, it will be re?
membered, held to the belief that
the Martians were anything but a
starving, needy people, and he con?
stantly sought to fortify his posi?
tion by offering new proofs of their
prosperity, advancement and skill.
In 1914 he found a new opportunity
for strengthening his pet belief by
announcing that instead of losing
any of their canals the Martians
had built two new ones, which could
be seen plainly through the tele?
scope.
"We have actually seen them
formed under our eyes," Professor
| Lowell said at the time, "and the
| importance of it car. hardly be over?
estimated. Tho phenomenon tran?
scends any natural law, and is only
explicable sc far as can be seen by
the presence out yonder of animate
will." By animate will he meant, of
course, human beings.
Professor Lowell was admittedly
tho leading spokesman for the
Martians, and anything he said
was worthy of the moat respectful
consideration, but in view of recent
developments many thinkers are
asking if, after all, he was not mis?
taken in at least one particular,
and if the "signals" picked up in
New York and London were not
efforts on their part to notify the
earth folk of their desperate plight.
Xo unusual manifestations to sup?
port this view have been witnessed
recently on the distant planet, but?
it is at least a new guess on the
subject, which is all that its origi?
nators claim for it.
Tesla Believes It
To Nikola Tesla there is nothing
remarkable or impossible in the sug?
gestion that the mysterious signals
are from the Martians. Discussing
the question, he said:
"To most people the mere idea of
flashing a signal over the immense
gulf of 50,000,000 or 100,000,000
miles will naturally appear prepos?
terous, but as I have stated in an
article I wrote for 'The Harvard
Illustrated Magazine' of March,
1907, it is simply a feat of electrical
engineering, apparently hazardous,
but made perfectly feasible through
inventions with which the experts
are familiar.
"That the planets are inhabited is
a foregone conclusion. It would be
stupid to deny the existence of con?
ditions suitable for the development
of organic life on other plftnet3."
The next question is how the
earth is to reply to these signals,
supposing they are signals at all
and what are the atmospheric ob
s-itacles that will have to be over
come.
Mars at times is only 50,000,00
miles away from the earth and a
other times 250,000,000. ft is frc
quently surrounded by vapors, a
is the case, too, with Venus, wfsicl
would be extremely difficult of pen
etration by light radiation, but thi
chief problem to be met would bi
the creation of a wireless apparatui
of sufficient strength to send a mes
sage over the required distance
Dr. Charles P. Steinmetz, chief con
suiting engineer of the Genera
Electric Company, believes such ai
instrument possible, provided tb
world devoted itself to the inventioi
with the same thoroughness it em
ployed in the great war, but esti
mates it would cost at least $1,000,
000,000 to do it
Wireless messages have bee
transmitted over a distance of fror.
3,000 to 4,000 miles when condition
were favorable, although an officii
of the Radio Corporation of Amei
ica, of which the Marconi system :
a part, said that signals had bee
sent as far as 10,000 miles und?
unusual circumstances.
"But there is one thing thi
should be remembered," said Davi
Sarnoff, comme??ial manager of ?
Radio Corporation of America, "thi
there are a great many conditions i
the atmosphere of which we do n<
know, even when sending a m-sssag
say, across the Atlantic or even
shorter distance.
"We know something about wa*
lengths, and we know what happe:
when we send a message and whi
we receive it, but what happens <
route is still pretty much of a mj
tery.
Niagara Falls Would Help
"In connection with the actr.
practicalities in sending a wirelt
message over such a distance as th
between the earth and Mars, that
may say, is something about whi
the newspaper men know almost
much as we do. But the ch
problem, it would seem to me, w??
be to find an instrument power
enough, rather than anything el
and this would be no small achie
ment. We would have to ham
Niagara Falls and every other po\
producing agency that I know of
do it."
Electricity travels at a speed o
little more than 186,000 miles

that rat? would take a little m
than twenty-two minutes to re
Mars when it is at its furthest p<
from the earth, and abaut four n

calculation it would take two n

Guglielmo Marconi, the r, :' v
father of Radio. V
* 4MMH HI M|
IF the patience of the folk on Mars
endures a little longer they finally
may succeed in their attempts to
get into communication with us. Marconi
of the wireless is comine here next
month to "listen" in on the messages he
believes are being flung through the
ether from the mysterious planet of
canals and supermen.
What will be the first message from
Mars? Even the imaginations of the
stolid scientists are stirred by this fantastic
attempt of Marconi. For years
scientists have attempted to perfect
some means of interplanetary communication,
ranging from immense rockets
to giant heliographs?and now radio.
Prof. Goddard of Clark College,
Massachusetts, at one time put forward
the suggestion that a giant rocket be
launched to the moon. But for the fact
that the idea appeared to be fathered by
the Smithsonian Institution ii would have
met only ridicule in scientific circles.
But given the Smithsonian
tuci O
was considerable discussion of this plan
until some one ventured to inquire what
was going to shoot the rocket off.
Projection of bright rays of light into
the sky, either by powerful searchlights
of tremendous power or by a gigantic
heliograph system of mirror:, placed in
some such locality as the Sahara Desert,
at one time appealed to science as the
most feasible way to establish communications
with Mars. Early in 1920 Preston
B. Bassett, research engineer of the
Sperry Gyroscope Company of Brooklyn,
asserted that there was no reason such a
method should not be entirely feasible.
Mr. Bassett, one of many who backed
the light system of communication with
he other planets, proposed the concentration
of the rays of 120 high intensity
searchlights of 1,000,000,000 candle-power
each into a single beam of 120,000,000,000
candle-power intensity, which would result
in a signal which, he claimed, could
be easily read on Mars, provided that
planet was Inhabited and that the inhabitants
possessed telescopic instruments of
equal strength to those used on earth.
But all methods suggested have been
proved impracticable even before given a
test. Radio seems to hold out the most
hope. Radio, Marconi reminds, gave science
our first real hope of interplanetary
communication
One night in January, 19<^ Marconi
operators in several different wireless
stations, of which the most important
was the London station, were siaftled by
a series of "mysterious" messages of extraordinary
wave length which tney could
not trace.
The operators wondered, unable to explain
these strange signals. Finally it
was observed that they were receiving a
series of S's. The "toe?toe?toe" was in
reality three dots, which In Morse code
represents the letter S. Each message
consisted of a group of three S's.
Later a query was broadcasted to wireless
stations the world over in an attempt
to find the source of the phantom signals.
It was found the messages were of no
"Could It be Mars?" a startled world
aRked Itself. And In answer a controversy
arose with one side defending the
Mars theory and the other bitterly opposing
It with explanations of "atmos- 1
pherlc discharges," "magnetic storms," |
"thunder storms on the sun'" ?nd other I
natural phenomena. <
Marconi at the time said: "I vould be
a bold speculator were I to dt.-lire posl- i
tively that one or more of the planets i
are attempting to send us some kind of <
messages, but it is equally futile to deny i
that such a thing Is possible, iu view of t

"What actually has happened in th
throbbing mystery is that signals hai
been received which apparently are di
to electro-magnetic waves of grei-t lengi
which are not merely stray signals."
Interest was revived in intero.anetai
communication?even in the minds <
thoso most skeptical of the source of tl
mysterloUR messages. Efforts were mat
to And the most feasible way to cast ele<
trie waves across the limitless inte
stellar spaces.
Dr. Charles P. Steinmetz, the enginee
lng wizard of the Ceneral Electric Cor
pany and recent inventor of "synthetk
lightning, at the time estimated that
wireless plant powerful enough to cast
wave length capable of reaching Mai
would cost $1,000,000,000 to construct ar
require from the whole country the sarr
degree of energy and thoroughness wit
which it entered the war. Lofty tower
1,000 feet high, would have to be coi
structed and all the electric power of tl
country would have to be concentrate
into one great power plant or sendir
station. He also said that metal balloor
filled with helium gas and sent up se>
eral thousand feet could be used instea
of the 1,000 feet high towers, whic
might prove cumbersome to construct.
If such a station should he built, th
resultant wave length would be beyond a
previous conjecture. Wave lengths c
r.,000 miles, while not common, are ofte
cast and signals have been sent as far a
10,000 miles under unusual circun
dances. However, there are a grea

the planet would thus be observed, it Is
true, and the spot would be moving

could probably be observed to insure
h some positive conclusions. In 1924
s Mars will be within 35,000,000 miles or

i- that time would be under the most
t favorable conditions,

that if communication is to be esn

0 United States, where radio has developed
1- in leaps and bounds during the last year
s or so. If he is to succeed in catching the
" iar nung messages irom mars 11 win De
here.
Probably the most serious difficulty,
aside from the engineering features of
the strange groping through space of two
planets, Is the lack of a common medium
for the exchange of thought. However,
if the Martians can generate a wave
length to reach from their planet to ours.
It Is possible that they will be of such
super-mentality that they will easily overcome
this drawback.
Again the question, "What will be the
first message from Ma$s?" Injects itself.
What will It reveal?
Will It plunge our earth back a thousand
years? Will it make our radio, telephonic
and telegraphic systems seem, by
comparison with those of Mars, to be as
crude as the smoke signals of the Indian
or the tomtom wireless of the African
bushman? Such questions as these are,
indeed, fearful to contemplate.
And how about the Martian himself?
the subject of so much earthly speculation?
Will he be, as II. G. Wells describes
him In his book "War of the Worlds," a
cross between a cuttlefish and a monkey,
with a round grayish body, with a "sort
of a face" and long, groping tentacles?a
gruesome, hideous thing to look upon? Or
will he be, as Edmond Perrler, director of
the Museum of the Jardlne des Plantes
and constructor of the first picture of the
Martian, describes him? The French
scholar held that the Martian bears a certain
resemblance to man, although many

"The life which animates the earth also
animates the other planets. Prom what
goes on around us we may divine what
is happening elsewhere by examining conditions
under which each planet finds itself

planets which are farthest away it is impossible
that human beings should exist,
for no organism could, for example, be
found in the alkaline wastes of Jupiter,
while Mercury, which is too near the Sun,

Earth and Mars are inhabitable.

The Spider's N
THE Field Museum in Chicago once
became infested with a large
number of obnoxious spiders.
They feBtooned the celling and great columns
of the building with yards of their
shuttle work. Scrubwomen and Janitors
tried in vain to rid the building of the
pests and their work. Finally a small
bird, known as the brown creeper, discovered
the state of things and decided
to take up its abode inside and Rssist the
authorities in ridding the building of the
pestB. I
For several days the bird flitted about
very much as it pleased, wagging up and 1
down column after column and probing 1
its bill into every crevice, and he actually
carried on a very effective work. i
One morning, however, as an official i
of the museum was passing, an attendant 1

He has further stated that the Martians
live in an intellectual Utopia?a Utopia
that is all the name implies.
Prof. Lowell, director of the observatory
at Flagstaff, Ariz., and one of the
greatest authorities on Mars, places the
Martian people on a much higher intellectual
plane than those on earth.
"Quite possibly," Prof. Lowell has written,
"the Martian folk are possessed of inventions
of which we have not dreamed,
and with them electrophones and kinetoscopes
are things of a bygone past, preserved
with the veneration in the museums
as relics of the clumsy contrivances
of the simple childhood of the race.
"Certainly what we see hints at the existence
of beings who are in advance of *
not behind us in the journey of life."
The canal system of Mars indicates that
the planet's inhabitants' are a race of
super-engineers. If they outshine us men- '

can expect to find that our "modern" and
much boasted of buildings are as the
tepees of the Sioux, our engineering
works no further advanced than the

IBH Ok? of Existence
How the Telescopes
on Earth Showed the
Firing of the Projec
tile* in Which the
First Invaders from
Mars Were Shot Out Into Space.
By Dr. W. H. Ballou.
THE reports of the leading astrono
mers show that the condition! of
life on the planet Mart at the pres
ent moment are becoming increasingly
hard and that if the planet is inhabited,
as appears probable, its people must now
be seeking some way of escape from their
miseries.
We are therefore confronted by the
possibility that has often been discussed
'>y imaginative scientists and others?a
descent upon the earth by the inhabitants
of Mars. Professor I/Owell, Professor
Pickering, Camille Flammarion and other
scientists, as well as H. G. Wells, have
pointed out that if the means of life were
failing on any planet it was logical to
expect the inhabitants would try to move
to some other planet. The only
question is how they would
move, und Mr. Wells may have
solved that problem.
Mart at the present moment
rT?-rs unusual opportunities for
observation to the astronomer, as
it is nearer to the earth than it
!i;ts V?een for many ypars. It is
mow only 42,350,000 miles away,
"hereas at this time last year It
vas 200.000,000 miles away!
Two years from now Mars will
l-e only 34.P00.000 miles away.
If they cannot attack us
this year, the Martians,
having suffered unbear
able miseries, will, per
haps, have perfected their
arrangements in the two
year period and may then
descend upon the earth in
devastating myriads.
Summer on Mars has now passed, and
even ordinary telescopes show that the
ice and snow cap around the poles of
Mars have spread further than ever, add
ing to the hardships of life on an ordi
narily cold and arid planet.
There is ample scientific evidence for
conjecturing that life on Mars has now
become a long agony which no earthly
creature could endure, and which even the
Martians, who have undergone ages of
adaptation, are finding unbearable.
Incessantly swept by terrible dust
storms, unable to find sufficient nourish
ment on an arid, froten globe, gasping
for breath in an exhausted atmosphere,
unable to find even water, the Martians
are living in an inferno that only the pen
of a Dante could describe.
All the evidence indicates that the Mar
tians must soon make a wholesale migra
tion to the earth or some other favorable
planet in the manner that imaginative
writers have suggested. Unless they do
so, they are faced with speedy annihila
tion.
This tragic situation lends great inter
est to the new illustrations Jnade by a
brilliant European artist, Alvim Correa,
for a French edition of H. G. Wells' "War
of the Worlds." It will be remembered
that in this famous work the Martians,
luing threatened with extinction, brcan
shooting themselves to the earth in vast
numbers.
They were all brain and no bones and
shaped much like giant octopuses. To
compensate for the lack of skeleton, their
bodies were enclosed in circular metal
cases and moved on enormous metal stilts
They nourished themselves on Mars by
transfusing blood from the bodies of man
like creatures. When they reached earth
they used men for food purposes and
were rapidly destroying the helpless popu
lation. They rapidly conquered London
and other important regions.
But on Mars the Martians had liv#d
entirely without disease germs and con
sequently possessed no acquired immunity
to them. With the blood of human beings
they drew in the germs of death and
rapidly succumbed without a struggle.
They had command of a burning ray,
which instantly shrivelled up any object
which it touchcd. ?
When the Martian invaders needed
food they picked up human beings in their
long tentacles, transferred their blood to
themselves and threw their empty car
casses away. /

seas to diversify its topography. More
, than one-half of Mars is a dreary desert,
and the rest is green only when the canals
are bringing water from the Polar ice
capa. He first described the great dust
rtorms which sweep over its equatorial
section, blotting out hundreds of square
miles of the planet's surface from our
view.
The physical conditions on Mars are
very different from those we have on
earth. The force of gravity exerted on
Mars is only three-eighths of that on. the
earth, while the atmospheric pressure that
is about fifteen pounds to the square inch
at sea level on earth is less than fo*ur
pounds on Mars. This would make it
possible for enormous weights to be lifted
on Mars with. little muscular effort, as
compared with the tasks on our planet.
Lowell figured that Martians could do
seven times more work than human beings
on earth with the same amount of effort.'
An elephant could leap like a gatelle
there, and a stone thrown into the air
would go very high and sink with a slow,
graceful motion, much like the apparent
action of a slowed-up movie camera.
The supposed signals from Mars, which
Marconi believed he had received on his
yacht Electra this Summer, may well have
something to do with distress on that
planet, although a different explanation
of them has been furnished.
It is commonly assumed that the Mar
tian, if he exists at all, has a much older
civilization than our own. The basis for
this assumption is the nebular hypothesis,
according to which the various planets
were thrown off in succession from the
mass of world-stuff which contracted as
it cooled, with the sun at its centre. On
this thesis thfe outer planets would ob
viously be older and Mars would presum
ably have been far ahead of us in de
veloping a living population.
We might fairly expect our elder plan
etary brother to take the initiative in
sending signals to the earth. Radio,
which is new with us, may bo an old, old
story with the Martians. Quite possibly
they have been patiently waiting thou
sands of years for us to become intellir.
gent enough to answer their signals.
If the Martian exists, and if he has a
radio system that can reach the earth, ho
should have no difficulty in revealing him
self to us. Nothing more itrould be neces
sary than to send a series of signals at
fixed intervals. If. for example, ne were
to make two ?ipnsls, then after an inter

four signals, we should know that he was ;
proving that he could add two and two.</text>

:
SINCE scientists, after years of
earnest and competent research,
have been unable to detect one
clear sign of manlike life on Mars, an
amazing theory is now being presented
to explain why the red planet may be
inhabited by a race of beavers. It is
a fascinating story of evolution.

How Butter Was
Discovered
AN Aryan horseman galloped
across an Asian plain one day
thousands of years ago, and dis
covered butter. This important event
wa3 one of those fortunate accidents
that have contributed so much to the
progress of man. It happened like
this, according to James A. Toby,
writing in Hygeia:
When the horseman started he had
with him a goatskin filled with sour
milk. The journey was long and
rough, the day moderately hot. When
he reached his destination and dis
mounted, seeking to appease hunger
and thirst, the Aryan was bewildered
to find something in his goatskin that
was unlike the milk he started with.
With some trepidation, for the acts
of the gods were often mysterious in
those days, he tasted the yellow mass.
Then he tasted it again, for it was
good. He told other herdsmen, who
probably scoffed at him as a fool, as
is customary when new benefits are
announced, but eventually they, too,
tried the product of the galloping
churn.
Soon the tribe was making butter,
hanging up the goatskins filled with
sour milk and beating them with
sticks or shaking them until the golden
mass appeared. That is the way but
ter is made to this day in some parts
o the world.

ancestors' into men. The
period of ice and cold
over wide areas of the
earth was caused, at least
in part, by the elevation
of continents and mount
ain ranges. On Mars, no
mountain ranges exist,
and it probably never had
an Ice Age.
It is on these hypoth
eses, as Thomas Elway
explains in Popular
Science Monthly, that
science bases its assump
tion that there is no hu
man intelligence on Mars,
and that animal life on
the planet is still in the
age of instinct. The
thing to expect on Mars,
then, is a fish life much
like that on earth, the
emergence of this fish life
onto the land, and the
evolution of these Martian
land-fishes into reptile

earth's present rodents
like rats, squirrels and
beavers, would make their appearance.
"The chief reason to expect this final
change of Martian reptiles into primi
tive mammals," says Mr. Elway, "lies
in the fact that on earth this evolution
seems to have been forced by change
able weather. And Mars now.possesses
seasonal changes like those on earth.
"Pure biological reasoning makes it
probable, therefore, that the evolution
of warm-blooded animals may have oc
curred on Mars much as it did here.
There seeni3 no reason to believe that
Martian life has gone farther than that.
Mars is a relatively changeless planet.
Biologists suppose that the rise and fall
of mountains, the increase and decrease
in volcanic activity, and the ebb and
flow of climate forced life on earth
along its upward path. Martian life
of recent ages seems to have lacked
these natural incentives to better
things.

knife has been patented by
Benjamin F. Court, of Long Beach.
Calif.
The handle of the knife is U-shaped
in cross-section, so that it will con
veniently fit over the handle of the
scissors blade.
A flat leaf spring inside the knife
handle exerts a pressure tending to
spread the two handles apart, and thus
open the device for use as a scissors.
On the other hand, a simple catch,
readily adjusted with a finger, locks
the handles together, so that the imple
ment can he used as a knife.
MUSK OXEN
THE United States Department of
Agriculture has newly pur
chased in Greenland thirty
musk oxen, which are to be shipped
to the town of Fairbanks, Alaska.
The aim in view is to restock Alaska
with these dwarf wild cattle, which
formerly were fairly numerous in that
Territory, but which are no longer
found there, having been wiped out
by ruthless slaughter. They are de
sirable animals, their meat being ex
cellent for food.
It is not intended to domesticate
them in Alaska. The small herd of
thirty is to be set at liberty near
Fairbanks, where there is a reindeer
station. Rigid enforcement of game
laws is expected to give the musk
oxen requisite protection. Other ship
ments from Greenland are contem
plated, and the natural increase of the
for the development of whose counter
part the supposed Martian conditions
would be ideal. That animal is the
beaver. It is either land-living or water
living. It has a fur coat to protect it
from the 100 degrees below zero of
the Martian night.
"Martian beavers, of course, would
not be exactly like those on earth. That
they would be furred and water-loving
is probable. Their eyes might be larger
than those of the earthly beaver be
cause the sunlight is not so strong, and
their bodies might be larger because of
lesser Martian gravity. Competent dig
ging tools certainly would be provided
on their claws. The chests of these
Martian beavers would be larger and
their breathing far more active, as
there is less oxygen in the air on Mars.
"Such beaver-Martians are nothing
more than pure speculation, but the
idea is based upon the known facts that
there is plenty of water on Mars; that
vegetation almost certainly exists there;
that Mars has no mountains and could
scarcely have had an Ice Age; and that
evidences of Martian life are not ac
companied by signs of intelligence.
"Herds of .beaver-creatures are at
least a more reasonable idea than the
familiar fictional one of manlike Mar
tians digging artificial water channels
with vast machines or the still more
fantastic notion of octopuslike Martians
sufficiently intelligent to plan the con
quest of the earth."
Any deduction about the life forms
on Mars or other planets, in the opinion
of leading astronomers, must start, if
it is to be at all reasonable, with the
idea of the distinguished Swedish scien
tist. Dr. Svante Arrhenius, of one kind
of life-germ pervading the entire solar
system. There is no reasonable way
for ALASKA
animals by breeding is counted on to
do the rest.
There has already been established
at the reindeer station near Fairanks
a sizable herd of buffalo, which seems
to find the climate suitable, and which
is showing a satisfactory increase.
There are, as is well known, herds of
buffalo in several of the national parks
of the United States, and, with the
present outlook, there is no reason to
apprehend the extinction of the
American bison.
The musk ox has never been do
mesticated. It is properly native to
latitudes adjacent to the Arctic Circle
all around the world. Its hair has the
fineness of silk, and is stronger than
linen fiber. An outer coat, so long
that it almost trails on the ground, is
thed in Summer.
In Arctic regions the silken hair of
the animal is woven into delicate fab
rice for garments, which are worn by
tribal chiefs.

even to guess the form of this life
germ. It may, perhaps, have drifted,
a tiny living spores, from planet to
planet, whirled through space by the
pressure of light.
Whatever its form, the life-germ,
biologists assume, probably developed
on Mars, much as it did on earth, in
oceans which have evaporated in the
course of ages.
The theory that Martian life evolved
along lines similar to those followed by
evolution of life on earth is supported
by at least one definite fact. Careful
spectroscopic studies at Mt. Wilson Ob
servatory, near Pasadena, Calif., and
elsewhere have disclosed that gaseous
oxygen exists in the Martian atmos
phere. The presence of oxygen gas is
highly significant, since the only known
way in which any planet can obtain
supply of this gas is through the life
activities of plants.
Following the lead of the great ex
pert in Martian astronomy, the late
Professor Percival Lowell, astronomers
long have recognized on Mars dark
colored spots and markings which are
believed to be plains or valleys covered
with vegetation. The oxygen which
spectroscopes show in the Martian air
is taken as another proof that this
vegetation exists.
Since the activity of plants is the.

only known process of cosmic chemis
try by which free oxygen can be pro
duced on the surface of a cooled planet,
the presence of oxygen in the rarefied
air of Mars indicates that vegetation
there must have produced oxygen out
of water and sunlight as it has done on
earth. It is difficult to exaggerate the
importance to Martian theorizing of
the definite fact that Mars has oxygen
and, therefore, vegetation.

have termed it the "most savage plant

Originally Dionaea muscipula, more
popularly known as "Venus'.- l'!y-trap,"
was discovered in North Carolina, and
it was at first doubted that this or any
other plant could live upon insects

has proved beyond peradventure that

American Museum ot Natural History,
New York City, said recently, would
be some indication of artificial light on
the planet. Undoubtedly, lighted cities
on Mars could be seen through the tele
scopes now in use.
However, as Mr. Elway points out,
there is one condition that prevents
satisfactory and conclusive observa
tion. When Mars is closest to the earth,
both planets are on the sane side of
the sun. Then only the sunlit side of
Mars is seen. To see any part of the
night side of Mars, observation must be
made when it is part way around in its
orbit toward the far side of the sun, so
that a slice of both the dark and the
lighted sides can be seen.
When even a part of the night side is
visible. Mars is relatively far away and
difficult to sec clearly. The Martians,
if there are any, would not have equal
difficulty in observing the dark side of
the earth, for when the two planets are
nearest to each other, the earth is show
ing Mars its dark side.
These consequences of the orbits in
which the two planets move might make
it difficult for the dim glow of lighted
Martian villages, were any such in ex
istence, to be detected from the earth.
Cities as bright as New York or Paris,
on the other hand, undoubtedly would
be visible.
Other students of the subject, how
ever, say it is possible that Martian
civilization may correspond to that of
an earlier, pre-artificial light era on
earth. In any case, astronomers agree
that there is a practical certainty that
Mars possesses kinds of life below hu
man intelligence.</text>

Conducted 'Two Hundred Years
Hence.
A visit to the electrical exhibition in
Paris will set unimaginative persons
wondering what kind of a world this
will be in that twenty-first century to
which M. Gambetta alluded the other
day. M. Gambetta remarked that if
Eeoplc were impatient to get all possi
le "political reforms effected at once
there would be nothing left for the
twenty-first century to accomplish; but
it is probable th'at in two centuries
henco the world will bo as different
lrom that of to-day as the latter is from
the world of the seventeenth century,
and we need not trouble ourselves to
leave work for it to do. It would hive
been thought a pretty conceit in Charles
ll.'s reign to talk of bringing water
intoevcry household by means of leaden
piping, and even Lord Worcester, in
his "Century of Inventions," never
imagined anything so fantastic as the
com eying of a combustible gas by such
a method; but we havo become used
now to mart els. and can easily foresee
the time 'when every house will havo its
electric battery, serving manifold pur
poses .and when most of thothmgs
Ione for as at present by steara'will be
performed by electricity. Wo'have no
occasion to worry ourselves aoout tne
possible exhaustion of the coal mines.
Long before the last scuttleful of coals
is drawn up from the last shaft, coal
will have ceased to be applied to most
of its present uses. I
In the house of the future there will
be no knocking at doors and summon
ing up servants every time a visitor
calls, ino visitor will loucfc a button
that will sound a bell, and then he will
speak through a tube: "Is Mr. Brown
at home?" Answer, "No." Instead
of dropping his card Mr. Robinson will
say that he leaves his compliments,
with kind inquiries; and these words
passing down the tube into the orifice
of a phonograph, will engrave N them
selves on a roll of tinfoil. When the
lady of the bouse comes home she will
turn the handle of her phonograph,
and hear, in tho very voices of her vis
itors, what they had to say: "I am Mr.
Jones, who has called for the third
time to know if it is convenient for you
to pay that little bill," and so on. Sup
posing Mrs. Brown to be short of funds,
she may want to communicate with her
husband in Bengal. How?- By letter,
or by the present slow and roundabout
telegraphs? Oh, no! Brown, as he
goes out to dine with some friends, will
be called back by hi 3 servant saying:
"Missis wants to speak to you, sir;
there's her bell ringing," and B., re
turning to his study let 'us. hope with
cheur.ul alacrity will see the form of
his consort projected into his pres
ence by means of the Pepper and
Dirk's apparatus acting in conjunction
with electric wires. Brown will forth
worth project his own presentment into
Mrs. It-'s London boudoir, and the con
versation will commence through the
telephone.
"Please, dear, send me a check for
JE20 this instant."
"Hero it is, my dear," and Brown,
taking up his electric stylus, fastened
to a wire, will write on tinfoil a draft
which will be reproduced wordfor word,
including his signature, on a correspond
ing piece of metal thousands of miles
oil. The best of this system will be that
it will enable ladies to administer cur
tain lectures at incalculable distances,
for you must remember that, although
Brown might possibly like to dispense
with such fruits of science, there will be
an electric bell at the head of his bed
which will leave him no peace until he
starts up and says meekly, with his ear
to the telephone: " Now, my dear, I'm
listening." He will gain nothing by
taking himself out of doors either, for
will not his wife be aole to speak into
his phonograph, so that the first time
he sets that instrument spinning her
woras will Durst iortn in an auectionaie
torrent, interspersed with sobs! It is
pleasant to reflect, however, that Brown
will be able to make peace by transmit
ting a kiss through the wires. We.
to-day, transmit sounds and shocks to
a great distance; why should not
our descendant) forward pleasant
sensations by electricity? No doubt
some time win elapse beiore every
house will be fitted up with a perfect
electrical apparatus;- out wnen tnese
contrivances get fairly established in
the dwelling of the rich, there will be
public electrical offices for persons of
small means. Cannot we imagine what
such an office would be with its vast
hall, its rows of batteries in compart
ments like "pews, and its crowds of
people streaming in to correspond with
friends far away? We may picture ,a
country couple coming in to have a
talk with their daughter in Australia:
"Do you want to see her or only to
speak to her?" asks the clerk. The
old couple hesitate, for it costs ten
shillings more to set the Pepper proc
ess in motion; but a wistful look passes
over the mother's face, and the father
winks to the clerk: " Aye, we must see
the lass," and after tho delay necessary
to call Betty from her electrical dairy.
where she is milking twelve cows all at
once by the Messrs. Puller s "Artihcial
Dairymaid" (patented), she will burst
into tho little box all rosy, smiling and
crying, too, may be. with the halo of
tne electrical ugnt round ner.
It cannot be doubted that our de
scendants will shoot electric currents
through their chop's and steaks and.
bring tnem up nzzing in a minute, ine
Frenchman's cotcllttte a la mintile will
then'bectme a reality'. All the produce
of the earth corn, fruit, Bowers, vege
tableswill bo cultivated by a happy'
combination of the sun and electricity
acting in concert. When the sun iscof.i
Ihe batteries.hvith their systems of col
ored glasses for intensifying the various
properties of the sun's rays, will go to
work, ami .there Will be no more talk of
backward potatoes then than there will
be of backward boys. The sluggish
vegetable, startled to its very root by
galvanic currents, will have to wake up
and take' its vivifying bath of warmth
streaming through revolving glasses of
red, blue and yellow; and it will be a
bad time for slugs, snails, caterpillars
and worms, wbo only exist at present
to consume what man wastes. Man
will waste nothing when lie grows to be
more knowing; and, of course, the
schools of the future will have their
systems for removing the defects of Na
ture'and inflating the brains of children
to something like uniform size. At
present we see children stunted, who
would grow up finely if they
could live in a sunny climate,
and young adults are djing all around
us of consumption because they cannot
afford to go to Madeira. Bnt will it be
so impossible 500 or 600 years hence to
bring tho climate of Madeira to London
by the help of the batteries and colored
glasses before mentioned? There will
be huge sanitariums b-ult, liko the
Crystal Palace, and containing dwell
ing houses, hotels, theaters and gar
dens, where the weak and the aged
will live and disport themselves. In
one the climate will be warm, in anoth
er bracing, and the managers will an
nounce that they have arranged to
bring the benehts of their unrivaled
establishment (please observe the ad
dress) within reach of the smallest
purses. At the same time means of
locomotion will be largely increased,
so that it will be possible to reach any
part of the globe within twelve hours.
.The principle of moving balloons by
elect ricity has already been discovered;
it only remains to manufacture an ap
paratus which shall be light enough, as
well as strong enough, to be carried up
high, and to send a b:g mass of silk,
cordage and car whizzing through the
air. When this difficulty has been sur
mounted. Brown, from Bengal, wish
ing to spend from Saturday to Monday
with his wife in London, will step into
on aerial car and be wafted hither with
his nnae in tho Messrs. Breathers'
"Artificial Respirator" (pUentcd). so
that he mav not lose his wind in the
velocity of his transit.
But what about standing armies and
the rivalry between Nations under the
forthcoming dispensation? Well, it is
highly probable that before the people
of this earth consent to live at amity
they will conscientiously try all the ap
pliances of science for the destruction
of one another. There will be awfnl
battles, first at sea with torpedoes, then
on land with electrical artillery and dy
namite shells, which will hash whole
;.l i.:.- ....1 ..-11., tk.
array corps mm uius u uuii
aerial navies of this world will smash
each other heartily in the cloud. After
this, when they have done one another
all the harm they can, the people of the
earth may take rest and agree thit war
is a poor way of killing time; but let
Generals and jingoes take heart. By
the time Nations havo begun to enjoy
universal peace somo method will have
been discovered of putting this globe
in communication with our nearest
neighbor, the planet Mar', and it is
easy to imag no wnat win iouow men.
After a brief period passed in'the ex-
c! ange of polite messages it will be
unanimously admitted that our globular
honor demands that we should de
clare war against Mars. Possibly
it wilt be found that our Mar
tian foes are more advanced in
science than we, and that the varia
tions in our climate result from some
unjustifiable liberties which they have
been taking with the sun by focusing
all its rays for themselves. We cannot
expect that our descendants will stand
this; so they will unite all their ener
gies lor the fabrication of mammoth en
gines which will discbarge oceans o
water, metal and fire right into the face
of Mars. In return the Martians will
pelt them with aeroliths weighing three
thousand tons, which will chip whole
mountains off tho Himalayas and make
a big holo where Mont Blanc now ex
ists. Alt? 'may not be forbidden us to
hope for a blessed time in the future,
when all the planets will be in com
munion and plnnged in.'continual wars,
to tend, of cojrse, "fri 'univc'rsaf peace.
Then, doubtless, man will have mas
tered all that ho is to know, and will
be ripe for other destinies which we
cannot even guess at. Giants will once
more-inhabit the earth giants of cult
ure, no more dressed in sums and
wielding clubs and we, their pigmy
forefathers; with our small heads and
hearts and our puny doings, vyill not be
so mucn as rememDereu among tnem.

"Grand, Intense, Formidable/9
Says M. Perrier
By Arnold D. Prince
IF IT should prove to be the case
after all that those mysterious
Marconi "messages" came from
Mars or even Venus, the next
problem of importance will be the
"dud of people who sent them. For,
of course, if the earth is to have new
neighbors with whom to exchange
gossip across the back yard of the
sidereal firmament, it will want to
know something about them. It will
want to know something of their
habits, appearance, how they dress,
act and possibly their views on in?
terplanetary relations. All sorts of
situations may arise wherein a
mutual understanding of personal
traits, characteristics and general
disposition will aid in establishing
and preserving amicable relations.
Signor Marconi, unfortunately,
was not able to throw much light on
the subject. Virtually all that came
within the scope of his observation
was that when prosecuting wireless '
experiments certain "signals oc?
curred'' with persistent regularity
which could not be explained on the
theory of casual interference. As '
these signals had been received
"simultanecuslv_ at New York and
London with identical intensity," he
admitted the possibility of their be?
ing attempts by the inhabitants of
fother planets to communicate"
with us.

What kind of people, then, in
i ?bit these two planots? In seek?
ing an answer to this question the
inquirer is thrown back almost ex?
clusively, of course, on the con?
clusions of the scientists who have
made a 6tudy of the subject. No
one, so far as known, is in a posi?
tion to give first hand information.
Nor is there anything specially help?
ful in such suggestions as emanated
recently from one authority, who,
when asked his opinion as to the
population on Venus, replied with
hopeful animation that they were
"chorus girls." Such jocularity is
merely beclouding the issue and add?
ing difficulties to a problem that is
difficult enough as it is.
Among scientists who have won
the righ*- to speak with authority
. the foreu?v- was the late Professor
Percival Lowell, director of the
observatory at Flagstaff, Ariz.
Professor Lowell was the brother
of Abbott Lawrence Lowell, presi?
dent of Harvard University. Be?
fore taking charge at Flagstaff he
had been attached to the observa?
tory at Harvard and had conducted
astronomical investigations in many
parts of the world, including Japan,
Tripoli, the Andes and other coun?
tries. He had delivered lectures on
his findings before important scien?
tific societies in Great Britain and
the United States.
Not only was Professor Lowell
convinced that Mars was inhabited,
but he believed the people had a
"?finch higher degree of intelligence
than those on earth. He dwelt
Particularly on their inventive
genius.
*i*eat Inventors
"Quite possibly," wrote Professor
'-owell in his book, "the Martian
[oik are possessed of inventions of
which we have not dreamed, and
"With them electrophones and kineto
scopes are things of a bygone past,
preserved with veneration in mu?
teras as relic? of the clumsy con?
trivances of the simple childhood of
the race.
'Certainly, what we see hints at
the existence of beings who are in
advance of, not behind, us in the
Journey of life.
"Startling as the outcome of
?**? observations' may appear at
-fr"*-"? in truth there ia npthing
?tartling about it whatever. Such
P?ttibility has been quite on the
??***? ?ver aince the existence of
-P*9HmM ?M -mocBisMd by the
Chaldean shepherds, or whoever the
still more primitive astronomers
may have been. Its strangeness is
a purely subjective phenomenon,
arising from the instinctive reluc?
tance of mind to admit the possi?
bility of peers. Such would be comic
were it not the inevitable conse?
quence of the constitution of the
universe. To be shy of anything
resembling himself is part and par?
cel of man's own individuality.
"Like the savage, who fears noth?
ing so much as a strange man; like
Crusoe, who grows pale at the sight
of footprints not his own, the civi?
lized thinker turns from the thought
of mind other than he himself
knows."
The peculiar relevancy of this
view to the discussion resulting from
Signor Marconi's announcement will
strike- any one who reads Professor
Lowell's statement. His brother
scientists were indeed "shy," as he
had predicted, of the deductions
reached by him, but they at least
contained the views of the Flagstaff
astronomer as to the kind of people,
who, if we accept the pleasing possi?
bility suggested by Signor Marconi,
are trying to "strike up a speaking
acquaintance" with us. Not only are
they masters in the knowledge of
electricity, but they have already
relegated to the museum of antiqui?
ties many of the discoveries in that
field which we, here on earth, look
upon as last minute achievements in
scientific effort.
Professor Lowell, while comment?
ing strongly on the intellectual at?
tainments of the Martians, made
little or no reference to the actual
appearance of the folk living on that
distant planet True, he did say in
another part of his book that they
probably were not interested in
party politics, and that, judging from
their canals, they were favored by a
"comprehensiveness" of mind much
more embracive than that "which
presided over the various depart?
ments of our own public works" in
the United States, but as politicians
look much like other persons very
little could be gained from that.
First Martian Pictures
It was M. Edmond Perrier, direct?
or of the museum of the Jardin des
Plantes, in Paris, who constructed
the first picture of the Martians, as
he conceived them.
At the time M. Perrier undertook
this task the division among the au?
thorities on Professor Lowell's the?
ory had assumed wide p reportions.
Some were decidedly "cold" to the
notion that Mars?the question as to
Venus was temporarily in eclipse?
was inhabited at all, and they con?
sidered it futile and profitless, there?
fore, to attempt to depict a non-ex?
istent people. Others, as has hap?
pened even recently, considered the
matter in a light vein, thinking to
get some humor out of it, and one
newspaper carried a cartoon, cap
tioned "Hello Central," showing Pro?
fessor Lowell "calling up" Mars.
Still another group seemed to take
it as a personal affront that the as?
tronomer had sought to enlarge their
list of acquaintances by introducing
a race about which they had abso?
lutely no knowledge.
M. Perrier approached the problem
from a highly speculative viewpoint,
but made clear the fact, nevertheless,
that he saw no reason for condemn?
ing the position of Professor Lowell.
"Dreams are not a crime," con?
tended the French scholar, "and in
this case contradiction i? difficult."
The director of the museum of
the Jardin des Plantes led up to his
description of the inhabitants of
Man by ?rtabiiahing the premia?,
that conditions on Mars are not
inimical to human life. Rain, snow,
thunder and hail are known there,
as on earth. There are seaweeds in
the ocean, grass and trees on the
land, fields available for cultivation
and a friendly soil to provide food
for the people.
"The life which animates the
earth also animates other planets,"
said the French savant. "From what
goes on around us we may divine
what is happening elsewhere by ex?
amining the exact conditions under
which each planet finds itself en
rapport with ? every other. On the
planets which are furthegt away,
it is impossible that human beings
should exist, for no organism could,
for example, be formed in the al?
kaline seas of Jupiter, while Mer?
cury, which is too near the sun,
could not engender life. Only Venus,
the Earth and Mars are habitable."
On Mars, M. Perrier went on, life
is "grand, intense, formidable." The
mean temperature is 40 degrees
Fahrenheit, as against 76 degrees
on earth, the winters are more se?
vere, the summers warmer, the year
longer and the seasons more marked
than ours.
The sea animals are, much like
ours, the fishes have a sense of hear?
ing, there are insects in the animal
kingdom and flowers and butterflies,
but the humans are very, very differ?
ent.
Before going on and giving M. Per?
ri?re picture of the kind of people
the Martians are, and in order to re
assure such sensitive souls as may I
fear to establish speaking relations I
with a people too alien in -appearance
to make acceptable neighbors, it
should be stated that M. Perrier does
not agree with the conception of the
Martians set forth by H. G. Wells in
his book "War of the Worlds." Mr.
Wells, in that work, caused the Mar?
tians to resemble cuttlefish, with
round, gray bodies, with "sort of
faces" and long, groping tentacles.
This conception, M. Perrier as?
serted, did the Martians a great in?
justice and created a prejudice
against them, which is not only un?
scientific and unsound, but entirely
undeserved.
The Martians, the French scholar
held, bear a certain resemblance to
man, although many of their fea?
tures are more prominent. For this,
the difference in the forces of grav?
ity and in environment are chiefly
responsible, he said. Their ears, for
example, are very large.
Continniug? tie? gsmtos of thai
museum of the Jardin des Plantes]
said:
. "The low atmospheric pressure
has produced a considerable devel?
opment of the pulmonary apparatus,
and consequently the general char?
acter of the Martians has been in?
fluenced by this development, which
is unknown on earth.
Why Martians Are Tall
"The men on Mars are tall be?
cause the force of gravity is slight.
They are blond, because the daylight
is less intense. They have less pow?
erful limbs. They have some of the
characteristics of our Scandinavian
type, although they probably have
larger skulls.
"Their large blue eyes, theii
strong noses, their large ears, con?
stitute a type of beauty which we
doubtless would not appreciate ex?
cept as suggesting superhuman in?
telligence."
Going further into details, M. Per
rier concluded that the jaw of the
Martian is narrower than ours.be
cause time and evolution have re
moved him further from his anima
forebears than they have us. His |
lung capacity is enormous because of
the thin atmosphere, although his
legs are extremely thin, due to the
little effort needed in walking. He
has little or no neck.
Touching on the question of intel?
ligence, the French savant deduced
j that ' the Martians have solved the
problem of existence, and know no
such thing as industrial strife. Be?
ing older, they are also wiser than
we. They have long since conquered
disease, and know the hour of their
demise, awaiting the event calmly.
They have overcome poverty, are
too sophisticated to engage in war,
and need no law or government to
keep them orderly. Philosophers
and brothers, they live in amity and
understanding, devoting all their
thought to the promotion of large
undertakings in which selfishness,
avarice and earthly trifles have no
part.
They are, in a word, as different
from tha ?*ncifui And unpieasing
picture painted by Wells as are we
from the Simian types referred to
by Darwin.
Returning to tho question of flora
and fauna, M. Perrier concluded
that because of the reduced force
of gravity, animals are much larger
on Mars than here, and hop, run
and fly about much more easily.
Grass is higher, fruit is bigger, and
the flowers possess undreamed of
beauty. The light is something lik?
our dusk, and the general landscape
much more attractive than on
earth.
"The year on Mars is twice as
long as our earthly one," he ex?
plained, "and hence plants and in?
sects have twice the time in whicr
to evolve. Mars is the land of hug?
plants and ideal flowers, of bird;
abnormally powerful in song an<
wondrous in appearance, and o:
four-footed animals with extraor?
dinarily developed fur and skin."
Neither M. Perrier ?or the other
scientists who believe in the habita
bility of other worlds paid so much
attention to Venus. They agreed,
however, with the head of the Jardin
des Plantes that as this planet is
much younger than the earth,
life there is much less advanced.
Because of the greater nearness to
the sun, the climate is something
like that in our tropics, and the air
is always misty. Animals and plants
are much like ours, especially at the.
poles, where the temperature is not
so high, but humans are not much
beyond the development that existed
on earth during the secondary geo?
logical period.
Not From Venus
In other words, there is much less
likelihood that those strange Marv
coni signals came from Venus than
that they came from Mars. j
Having thus disposed o? the kind j
of beings supposed to exist on the
only two eligible planets, two other
questions arise?Why are the Mar?
tians or the Venusians trying to
communicate with us, that is, if they
are? and, What atmospheric condi?
tions will we on earth have to over?
come in order to reply to them?
As to tho first question, a possible
explanation may be found in Jtha
so-called cataclysm on Mars that was
I reported by the British Astronomical
Association in 1909. In that year
the "planet of mystery" was nearer
to earth than at any time since 1892,
and so in a favorable position for
observation.
The phenomenon which was her?
alded as without parallel in the rec?
ords of the past was the appearance
of a gloomy, yellow veil which en?
shrouded immense tracts of the Mar?
tian surface, obliterating important
markings.
On account of the theory, then
recently advanced by Professor
Lowell, that Mars was inhabited, the
changes aroused extraordinary inter?
est. It previously had I*? ;i sug?
gested that the canals on the planet
had been constructed by a dying
race, a race menaced by starvation
on a desert planet, which had sought
by means of these enormous via?
ducts to carry water from t?e melt?
ing ice caps at the poles, and the
appearance of the yellow mist com?
bined with the simultaneous erasure
of some of the canal markings gave
riso to the fear that a gigantic
i
Professor Lowell Held That Mar?
tians Were Far Advanced in
Inventions and Science
catastrophe had occurred, the effects
of which were only too apparent.
Can it be, some of the observers
of conditions now are asking, that
CCIENTISTS agree that
*"* the people of Mars differ
from us in many ways. The
Martians are believed to
have very large noses and
ears and immense lung de?
velopment, because of the
rarefied atmosphere. Their
legs are poorly developed, be?
cause matter on Mars weighs
less than here and sturdy
legs are not needed to bear
their weight. Birds and but?
terflies are very large and j
beautiful
?some such similar catastrophe has j
overtaken the Martians, who, in
their desperation, are attempting to
communicate the fact to us?
In August, 1909, astronomers
working at their telescopes had re?
ported what they surmised to be a
new fracture of the southern polar
cap and the appearance of a dark
streak along the line of the break.
About the same time a brilliant spot,
which may have been a segment of
the shattered terrain, had- separated
itself from the polar cap and had
moved over to one of the dusky
areas of the planet, partly hiding it
from view.
Great Convulsion Possible
All this seemed to strengthen the
theory of a huge convulsion ad?
vanced by the British scientists, al?
though, as seems to be the fate of all
questions concerning this much dis?
cussed and little understood celes?
tial body, eminent authorities at
once took opposing ground on the
subject.
Professor Harold Jacoby, Ruther?
ford Professor of Astronomy at
Columbia University, contended that
"the Martians are not likely to have
their world destroyed any more than
are we," adding that if any such
catastrophe as hinted had actually
occurred the news would have be?
come known through some quicker
channel than the British Astro?
nomical Association. By this, it
should be explained hastily, Profes?
sor Jacoby did not mean that the
scientists across the Atlantic were
slower in observation than others,
| but only that the disaster would
have been revealed by telescopes
! everywhere long before a formal
| report could have been prepared.
Professor F. R. Moulton, of the
! University of Chicago, also doubted
the accuracy of the report, and Pro?
fessor Lowell himself, author of the
notion that Mars is inhabited, was
not particularly impressed with it. .
Professor Lowell, it will be re?
membered, held to the belief that
the Martians were anything but a
starving, needy people, and he con?
stantly sought to fortify his posi?
tion by offering new proofs of their
prosperity, advancement and skill.
In 1914 he found a new opportunity
for strengthening his pet belief by
announcing that instead of losing
any of their canals the Martians
had built two new ones, which could
be seen plainly through the tele?
scope.
"We have actually seen them
formed under our eyes," Professor
| Lowell said at the time, "and the
| importance of it car. hardly be over?
estimated. Tho phenomenon tran?
scends any natural law, and is only
explicable sc far as can be seen by
the presence out yonder of animate
will." By animate will he meant, of
course, human beings.
Professor Lowell was admittedly
tho leading spokesman for the
Martians, and anything he said
was worthy of the moat respectful
consideration, but in view of recent
developments many thinkers are
asking if, after all, he was not mis?
taken in at least one particular,
and if the "signals" picked up in
New York and London were not
efforts on their part to notify the
earth folk of their desperate plight.
Xo unusual manifestations to sup?
port this view have been witnessed
recently on the distant planet, but?
it is at least a new guess on the
subject, which is all that its origi?
nators claim for it.
Tesla Believes It
To Nikola Tesla there is nothing
remarkable or impossible in the sug?
gestion that the mysterious signals
are from the Martians. Discussing
the question, he said:
"To most people the mere idea of
flashing a signal over the immense
gulf of 50,000,000 or 100,000,000
miles will naturally appear prepos?
terous, but as I have stated in an
article I wrote for 'The Harvard
Illustrated Magazine' of March,
1907, it is simply a feat of electrical
engineering, apparently hazardous,
but made perfectly feasible through
inventions with which the experts
are familiar.
"That the planets are inhabited is
a foregone conclusion. It would be
stupid to deny the existence of con?
ditions suitable for the development
of organic life on other plftnet3."
The next question is how the
earth is to reply to these signals,
supposing they are signals at all
and what are the atmospheric ob
s-itacles that will have to be over
come.
Mars at times is only 50,000,00
miles away from the earth and a
other times 250,000,000. ft is frc
quently surrounded by vapors, a
is the case, too, with Venus, wfsicl
would be extremely difficult of pen
etration by light radiation, but thi
chief problem to be met would bi
the creation of a wireless apparatui
of sufficient strength to send a mes
sage over the required distance
Dr. Charles P. Steinmetz, chief con
suiting engineer of the Genera
Electric Company, believes such ai
instrument possible, provided tb
world devoted itself to the inventioi
with the same thoroughness it em
ployed in the great war, but esti
mates it would cost at least $1,000,
000,000 to do it
Wireless messages have bee
transmitted over a distance of fror.
3,000 to 4,000 miles when condition
were favorable, although an officii
of the Radio Corporation of Amei
ica, of which the Marconi system :
a part, said that signals had bee
sent as far as 10,000 miles und?
unusual circumstances.
"But there is one thing thi
should be remembered," said Davi
Sarnoff, comme??ial manager of ?
Radio Corporation of America, "thi
there are a great many conditions i
the atmosphere of which we do n<
know, even when sending a m-sssag
say, across the Atlantic or even
shorter distance.
"We know something about wa*
lengths, and we know what happe:
when we send a message and whi
we receive it, but what happens <
route is still pretty much of a mj
tery.
Niagara Falls Would Help
"In connection with the actr.
practicalities in sending a wirelt
message over such a distance as th
between the earth and Mars, that
may say, is something about whi
the newspaper men know almost
much as we do. But the ch
problem, it would seem to me, w??
be to find an instrument power
enough, rather than anything el
and this would be no small achie
ment. We would have to ham
Niagara Falls and every other po\
producing agency that I know of
do it."
Electricity travels at a speed o
little more than 186,000 miles

that rat? would take a little m
than twenty-two minutes to re
Mars when it is at its furthest p<
from the earth, and abaut four n
utes and twenty-one seconds whe:
is nearest. According to the it
calculation it would take two n
utes and eighteen seconds to sen
radiogram to Venus, two mini

minutes to Jupiter, one hour and
minutes to Saturn, two hours

        <text>IF TEXAS TALKS WITH MARS.
It we are to credit a telegram from
two Fort Worth newspaper to Profes
sor Pickering of Harvard, Texas is wil
line to stand behind the professor in
ilia proposed effort to signal Mars. The
telegram does not say whom the SIO,
000,000 that Professor Pickering has
called for is to come from. But that
9s a minor detail. Texas says the
money is there.
We can readily understand the de
aire of Texas to get the opinion of dis
interested onlookers, like the inhabit
ants of Mars, on many matters of
state interest. They naturally feel
that envy of the wonderful resources,
else and history of Texas makes the
citizens of our own planet at best but
olased Judges. The inhabitants of
Mars, unmoved by small considera
tions, could be relied on to give free
rein to their natural admiration.
Probably the first question that the
Texans would wish Professor Picker
ing, with his 110,000,000 heliograph, to
signal to Mars would relate to a cer
tain hotly disputed point in the use of
firearms. As the state is divided be
tween those who hold that firing
from ths pocket Is f unsportsmanlike
and those who say it isn't, and also
between the advocates of shootta
from the nip and those who believe in
drawing a more deliberate bead, the
opinion of the Martians on these mat
ters Would ' be peculiarly ' Interesting
sad might possibly lead to harmony
and unanimity.
It goes without saying that these or
similar inquiries would be likely to
follow In Quick succession: "Do you
remember the Alamo?" "Which is
generally regarded as the most import
ant event is Mars, the battle of Get
tysburg or the battle of San Jacinto?"
"Has a greaser any rights that a white
man is bound to respect, according to
your point of view?" "Is the percentage
against the player greater In Mexican
monte or faro bank?" "Did you ever
hear of Ben Thompson, the Austin bad
man, once owner of the Iron Front
saloon and gambling house?" "What is
thoueht of the way he was assassinat
ed in that San Antonio variety thea
ter?" "Do you not think Braan was a
greater writer than Shakespeare?" t
Unless precautions, should be takeu
to prevent the Introduction or the sub
J set, the Martians also would surely be
asked whst they thought of Senator
Ballsy and the Waters-Pierce Oil com
pany.
But If the Martians are half as wise
as Professors Pickering and Lowell
say, they will decline to commit them
selves on Bailey. They will realize
that a message from Mars could have
no other effect than to aplit the two
political factions wider apart than ev
er and make one or them the relent
less enemy of Mars and Martians and
the opponent of all further communi
cations. Professor Pickering should accept
the offer of the Texans while they are
in the mood for experiments. He can
not be too quick about it either. Some
legislator is likely to introduce a bill
further regulating the length of bed
sheets or providing for the complete
extermination of the Standard Oil
company, and thus turn the popular
Impulse of Texas in an entirely differ
ent direction. Chicaso later-Ocean.</text>
